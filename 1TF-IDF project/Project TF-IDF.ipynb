       "['the once ruddy face was puffy and pale the brushed-back gray-brown hair was straight and thin--not the wiry dark curls of a few year ago he walked stiffly although his figure was trim and erect behind his glasses his dark brown eyes looked fixed and he seemed to be daydreaming at the age of 77 the legendary g-man--in his 48th year as director of the federal bureau of investigation--the most enduring and perhaps if there is such a thing as a cumulative total the most powerful official in the long span of the american government--looked deceptively like any other old gentlemen in the hotel lobby in one of his rare reflections on mortality a few years ago mr hoover told a reporter \"the greatest enemy is time\" time advances against this seemingly indestructible official had become obvious but then mr hoover was always more human than he or the myth admitted mr hoover power was a compound of performance and politics publicity and personality at the base of it all however was an extraordinary record of innovation and modernization in law enforcement--most of it in the first decade or so of his tenure the centralized fingerprint file the print total passed the 200-million mark this year at the identification division 1925 and the crime laboratory 1932 are landmarks in the gradual application of science to police work the national police academy 1935 has trained the leadership elite of local forces throughout the country mr hoover recruitment of lawyers and accountants although they now make up only 32 percent of the special agent corps set a world standard of professionalism the national crime information center enables 4000 local law enforcement agencies to enter records and get questions answered on a network of 35 computer systems with its headquarters at the fbi office here from the start mr hoover got results his bureau rounded up the gangsters in the nineteen- thirties it made the once epidemic crime of kidnapping a rarity \"virtually extinct\" as the director friends like to say it arrested german saboteurs within days after their submarines landed them on the atlantic coast and in one of its most sensational coups the fbi seized the slayers of mrs viola gregg liuzzo only hours after the civil rights worker shotgun death in alabama in 1965 the fbi does not catch everybody and it is sometimes many months before any of its \"most wanted\" suspects are arrested but mr hoover executed enough seemingly miraculous swoops to make any specific criticism perilous mr hoover always understood the subtle currents of power among officials in washington better than anyone know him not a new dealer at heart he had nonetheless dazzled president franklin d roosevelt with his celebrated success against kidnappers he got results roosevelt liked him; he slapped the fbi director back and laughed when mr hoover confessed that an agent had been caught in the act of illegal wiretapping and he was amused at the bureau temerity in putting a spy on harry hopkins roosevelt counselor in london roosevelt assignment of counter-espionage duties to the fbi as war loomed in 1936 expanded the bureau size and heightened mr hoover prestige but when the republicans won the white house again in 1952 mr hoover loyalty swung immediately to the new team the more awesome mr hoover power grew the more plainly he would state for the record that there was nothing \"political\" about it that the fbi was simply a \"fact-finding agency\" that \"never makes recommendations or draws conclusions\" the most pointed such declaration coming in the furor about harry dexter white in 1953 was paradoxically one of mr hoover most political acts in a speech in chicago herbert brownell president eisenhower attorney general said that mr white who had served as assistant secretary of the treasury under roosevelt was named in 1946 as the united states executive director of the international monetary fund even though president truman had been told that mr white was a soviet spy mr truman in retirement replied that the fbi had contributed to the judgment that it would be safer to keep mr white in office under observation that to dismiss him rushing before senate investigators mr hoover did not question the \"conclusion\" that mr white was a spy--although the fbi evidence had not been enough to persuade a grand jury to indict mr white before he died in 1948 as for mr white promotion to the international monetary fund mr hoover stated emphatically that while he knew of mr truman reasoning he had not been in on the decision nor had he approved it at a time when the republican party chairman was promising to make communism in government the central issue of the 1954 congressional campaign mr hoover eager testimony was taken by some to be a boldly partisan move house speaker sam rayburn was one of many democrats who never forgave mr hoover and encouraged speculation that a democratic president would find a new fbi director but mr hoover reappointment was virtually the first decision john f kennedy announced on the day after his election to the presidency in 1960 despite its acrimonious endings the hoover-kennedy relationship started out cordially based apparently on mr hoover long acquaintance with the president father the late joseph p kennedy robert kennedy had urged the president-elect to retain mr hoover; and when john kennedy weighed assignments for his brother mr hoover urged him to follow his instinct and make robert the attorney general later robert kennedy and mr hoover fought a long tug-of-war over the assignment of agents to civil rights and organized crime cases mr hoover was not used to having an immediate boss who could block his access to the white house he was annoyed when the attorney general installed a \"hot line\" between their justice department offices and was even more annoyed when robert kennedy had the fbi phone moved from the desk of helen gandy mr hoover long- time secretary to the director desk robert kennedy never forgave mr hoover for the cold telephone call that brought the first word of his brother assassination mr hoover voice robert kennedy told william manchester the author was \"not quite as excited as if he were reporting the fact that he had found a communist on the faculty of howard university\" later according to william w turner a former agent who wrote an unflattering book on \"hoover fbi\" robert kennedy called back on the hot line \"hoover was in his office with several aides\" mr turner wrote \"when it rang  and rang  and rang when it stopped ringing the director snapped to an aide \\'now get that phone back on miss gandy desk\\'\" although robert kennedy remained attorney general until the summer of 1964 he and mr hoover never spoke again after the president assassination until representative hale boggs of louisiana the house majority leader criticized mr hoover in the house last spring as a \"feudal baron\" and a wire-tapper the fbi director had been sacrosanct in congress\\' deference the case of former senator edward v long a missouri democrat who denounced government wiretapping and was quickly undone by life magazine disclosure leaked from the fbi that he was splitting legal fees with a teamster lawyer in st louis is often cited as an example of the director tactics mr hoover insisted that he did not tap the phones or \"bug\" the offices of congressmen and mr boggs failed notably to prove the contrary but mr hoover always had other ways to keep critics in line anyway the late senator kenneth d mckellar a tennessee democrat and chairman of the senate appropriations committee harassed mr hoover from time to time in the nineteen-thirties and in the spring of 1936 drew the blushing testimony that the director of the fbi had never made an arrest less than a month later as if by magic mr hoover led a raid in new orleans that captured alvin kreepy karpis a star of the ma barker mob by his own account mr hoover rushed up to the un-suspecting karpis as he sat in a car threatened him with a gun then snapped out the order to other agents: \"put the cuffs on him boys\" in his recently published memoirs karpis contends that mr hoover \"hid until i was safely covered by many guns he waited until he was told the coast was clear then he came out to reap the glory\" karpis account is obviously suspect and about 35 years too late to undo senator mckellar embarrassment when senator mckellar tried to cut $225000 out of the fbi budget that year senator arthur h vandenberg of michigan denounced him according to one report of the senate debate \"as a miser whose parsimony would cause the threat of kidnapping to hang once more over every cradle in america\" mr hoover full budget request was then passed by a resounding voice vote since that time the senate has never questioned the fbi budget as reported by the house and in the house the veteran chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that theoretically reviews the bureau spending representative john j rooney democrat of brooklyn said that \"i have never cut [mr hoover] budget and i never expect to\" as some of the men closest to him volunteer mr hoover primary genius might well have been publicity he had some famous fights with other police agencies--notably after the capture of bruno hauptmann the lindbergh kidnapper in 1933--to secure public credit for his bureau but mr hoover was no ordinary headline grabber the real foundations of his legend are built on more solid stuff than press relations; certainly his image was never dependent on the goodwill of newspapermen to whom mr hoover was normally inaccessible mr hoover never held a news conference the closest thing to a mouthpiece in the press was not a political pundit or a crime reporter but the late walter winchell the broadway gossip columnist who traveled with an fbi escort and carried an item about \"g-man hoover\" almost every day the making of the hoover folk hero in which mr winchell played a large part was undertaken purposefully in the early thirties--long after the director quiet administrative mastery had established him securely speakeasies were the fashion gangsterism ravaged the land capturing headlines and in a sense the public fancy for mr hoover the last straw was the kansas city massacre of june 17 1933 in which charles pretty boy floyd and his gang killed five men including an fbi agent and three local policemen \"if there is going to be publicity\" the director raged \"let it be on the side of law and order\" looking about for a symbol mr hoover found himself and proceeded to orchestrate a dazzling range of movies books radio dramas and comic strips mr hoover understood pop culture and its evolution he promoted \"junior g-man\" clubs for boys and sold two and a half million copies of \"masters of deceit\" a book on communism his \"ten most wanted\" list made a lot of seedy drifters into headline material in the age of television he shrewdly reserved the right to select the actor efrem zimbalist jr who would represent the fbi in millions of living rooms in a popular television series the late senator george norris of nebraska called mr hoover \"the greatest hound for publicity on the american continent\" even chief justice harlan fiske stone who had appointed the fbi director in 1924 observed critically that \"one of the great secrets of scotland yard has been that its movements are never advertised\" popularity was high but mr hoover once committed to a public fight on crime played the role with all his fierce energy he unquestionably made a brilliant success of it even after political pot-shots at the director became fashionable in recent years a gallup pol for newsweek magazine last spring showed that 80 per cent of those who had any opinion about mr hoover rated his performance \"good\" or \"excellent\" any general accounting of the fbi director power must also take not of the fact that his personality as well as his office has always inspired fear francis biddle president roosevelt attorney general in the early nineteen-forties sensed that behind mr hoover \"absolute self- control\" was \"a temper that might show great violence if he did not hold it on leash subject to the domination of a will that is the master of his temperament\" there were hints of that temper in his passionate criticisms--favorite phrases such as \"mental halitosis\" and the \"jellyfish\" tag he put on former attorney general ramsey clark and mr hover had a hair-trigger sensitivity to criticism when the warren commission was investigating president kennedy assassination and said that the fbi had not shared its intelligence fully with the secret service mr hoover lashed out at what he called \"a classic example of monday morning quarterbacking\" a charge that gravely displeased president johnson and when the rev dr martin luther king jr said that southern blacks could not turn to their local fbi offices with any assurance of sympathy or zeal for civil rights mr hoover called dr king \"the most notorious liar in the country\" later mr hoover had his staff invite newsmen to hear the taped record of fbi bugs in dr king hotel rooms as evidence that \"moral degenerates\" as mr hoover put it were leading the civil rights movement this was a rare extension of mr hoover lifelong practice of entertaining attorneys general and presidents with spicy details about the secret lives of famous people critics within the fbi were crushed summarily and men who were thought to have been good friends of the director reveal deeper levels of hostility in casual conversations \"i\\'m afraid of him\" said a former aide who would seem to have been secure in a new and completely different public career \"i can\\'t imagine what he\\'d do to me but i\\'d rather not mess with him\" john edgar hoover was born in washington on new year day in 1895 the youngest of three children of dickerson n hoover an easy-going federal official and the former annie m scheitlin the granddaughter of switzerland first consul general in america the hoovers\\' stucco house on steward square has been torn down but mr hoover birthplace is memorialized in a stained glass window of the presbyterian church that stands on the site of the house mrs hoover who has been described as \"old-world strict\" instilled in her son an intense discipline and stern sensitivity to moral issues by all accounts she was the dominant influence on his character as a boy he was known as \"speed\"--a reference apparently to his agile mind rattling speech and efficiency as a grocery delivery boy in the capitol hill section of washington admirers have compared his physique to babe ruth--heavy torso spindly legs--and indeed his flattened nose was the result of a hard-hit baseball but mr hoover was never an athlete remembering a day in 1909 when the football coach at central high school rejected the puny volunteer brought twinges ever after in his disappointment young hoover turned all the more intensely to the school military drill team of which he became captain and to public speaking according to one biographer he never had a regular girl friend in high school; friends teased him wrote mildred h comfort \"and accused him of being in love with company a\" an institutional attachment fore-shadowing his marriage to the fbi as a debater young hoover argued \"the fallacies of women suffrage\" with gusto and competitive success he was valedictorian of his class and was described in the school yearbook as \"a gentleman of dauntless courage and stainless honor\" in his high school days he also was a choir boy and sunday school instructor lessons on indexing although the university of virginia offered him a liberal arts scholarship mr hoover feared that his living expenses would be a burden on his father instead he took a $30-month clerk job at the library of congress he would apply indexing lessons to law enforcement later and enrolled at george washington university where he was able to win his law degree in three years with a master degree in 1917 mr hoover passed the bar and moved into a $1200-a-year job at the department of justice--his only employer over a stretch that exceeded 55 years from the start according to jack alexander 1937 profile of mr hoover in the new yorker he stood out from the other young lawyers around him \"he dressed better than most a bit on the dandyish side\" mr alexander wrote \"he had an exceptional capacity for detail work and he handled small chores with enthusiasm and thoroughness he constantly sought new responsibilities to shoulder and welcomed chances to work overtime when he was in conference with an official of his department his manner was that of a young man who confidently expected to rise\" mr hoover first assignment in \"counter-radical activities\" left a profound mark this was at the end of president wilson second term the era of the \"red raids\" under attorney general a mitchell palmer evidently caught up in the official agitation about bombs and bolshevism mr hoover took charge of assembling a card file on 450000 \"radicals\" and built his first informer network--a controversial tool of police work that he used with dramatic results later against the communist party and the ku klux klan many years later mr hoover said he had always \"deplored\" the hysterical dragnet arrests of thousands of innocent aliens in 1919 and 1920 but the record is also clear that as the head of the new general intelligence division at the justice department he was responsible for planning the raids if not their execution a still darker era followed under president harding within the justice department according to alpheus t mason the historian the bureau of investigation \"had become a private secret service for corrupt forces within the government\" mr hoover nearly quit in disgust when harlan fiske stone became attorney general under president coolidge in 1924 he determined to rebuild the bureau after the image of scotland yard and sought as his director a man experienced in police work but free of the \"more usual police tradition that it takes a crook to catch a crook and that lawlessness and brutality are more to be relied upon than skill and special training\" secretary of commerce herbert hoover an untainted holdover from the harding administration recommended j edgar no relation as \"a lawyer of uncommon ability and character\" attorney general stone who held the appointive power offered him the job but mr hoover who was then only 29 years old did not leap at what was unmistakably the chance of a lifetime with confidence and cunning that were very much in character he said he would accept the assignment only if appointments to the bureau were divorced entirely from outside politics and if he would have sole control over merit promotions mr stone replied that he would not allow hoover to take the job under any other conditions and thus in 1924 the modern bureau-- renamed the federal bureau of investigation in 1935 --was born organizing principle from the start mr hoover personal grip on all the important strings was the organizing principle at the bureau it had everything to do with discipline and morale; mr hoover made siberia assignments and the compassionate transfers it had a lot to do with the agency efficiency and its incomparable record of probity under the hoover inspection system there were no secrets and no independent power centers in the fbi in recent years the system also seemed to have inhibited the bureau from taking worthwhile risks \"the first rule\" according to one former agent was: \"do not embarrass the director\" the insulation from outside politics meant free play for hoover politics the 15000 fbi employees had neither the civil service nor a union to inhibit the director whims he shaped the bureau in his own victorian image and changed in the process himself personal affairs were strictly regulated at the bureau women were not allowed to smoke on the job no one got a coffee break a clerk was once dismissed for playing with a yo-yo in the halls in a case that went to court in 1967 a 26-year-old clerk was dismissed for keeping a girl friend in his apartment overnight agents have been reprimanded for reading playboy magazine and transferred for being over-weight mr hoover wore custom-made brooks brothers shirts and suits and he ordered his agents to dress carefully like young businessmen the unofficial uniform for an agent includes a white shirt dark suit snap-brim hat and a handkerchief in the jacket pocket one-man rule also bred sycophancy flattery worked wonders around mr hoover according to an inside student of the director office \"let say you\\'re an agent\" he said \"go in there and tell him he looks better than ever that you are inspired by his leadership that he saving america and you hope he lives forever as soon as you leave there will be a memo from the director saying \\'this man has executive ability\\' a lot of agents have caught on\" agents admittedly quaked at the thought of the director disapproval expressed typically in the bright blue ink of mr hoover stub pen in the margins of their memorandums his language was vehement this is asinine!\"; the filling of all four borders around a typewritten sheet was known as a \"four-bagger\" once it was said when an assistant memorandum so filled the page that mr hoover barely had room for a comment he wrote \"watch the borders\" and his puzzled but obedient aides dispatched agents to patrol the canadian and mexican borders for a week friends and detractors all agree that the system has mirrored and fed a colossal ego in the office for instance mr hoover never circulated; people came to him he sat amid flags behind a raised polished mahogany desk at the end of a 35-foot office visitors if they sat sank into deep leather chairs and inevitably looked up to the throned director a day in the life of j edgar hoover testified to his unflagging energy and to the power of habit the few changes in his routine were forced on him; his friend clyde tolson the fbi associate director was not well enough to walk the last few blocks to the office in recent days so their morning strolls along constitution avenue were abandoned the old harvey restaurant was razed so mr hoover and mr tolson had lunch instead at the mayflower hotel next door on connecticut avenue old patterns persisted the chauffeur picked up mr hoover and then mr tolson about 9 o\\'clock every morning and delivered them to the office about 9:30 at the end the director was still the complete master of the bureau huge flow of paper work he did little sleuthing himself but he kept abreast of the fbi major cases certain categories of business were handled by mr hoover alone including high-level personnel decisions liaison in other than routine matters with congress the attorney general and the white house and anything that brought unfavorable publicity on the bureau he left for lunch at 11:30 am returned by 12:45 pm and usually took work home with him when he left for the day at 4:30 there were things he did not do anymore he outlived the stork club in new york where he long enjoyed cafe society attention and the friendship of sherman billingsley the owner he no longer tended the azaleas around his house he had to give up his favorite angel food cake and chocolate cream pie to keep his weight down once an avid walker he said that \"conditions in this city\" presumably a reference to the crime rate kept him out of rock creek park formerly a favorite stamping ground near his house some continuities still the continuities in his life were as noticeable as the changes: the jack daniel whiskey before dinner; the miami vacation during the last two weeks of december and the july break and physical checkup in la jolla calif the passion for horse racing; and above all the friendship with mr tolson a fellow bachelor with whom mr hoover had lunch and dinner six days a week since the late nineteen-twenties mr tolson who always stayed a respectful step behind mr hoover in their famous walks together lagged severely after two strokes and open-heart surgery but the friendship was a s fast as ever and through a special personnel device that mr hoover engineered to get around mr tolson physical disability mr tolson remains the bureau second-ranking officer together they frequented the racetracks around washington as well as gulfstream in miami and delmar in la jolla mr hoover who applied the same analytical imagination to the racing charts that he once used on kidnapping rings was still bothered by touts who recognized him and wanted to tip him on a sure thing but he bet only $2 on each race and would leave in disgust if his losses went over $10 friends say it was mr tolson not mr hoover who sent junior fbi agents around to the $50 and $100 windows with heavy side bets mr hoover humor usually ran to heavy-handed practical jokes the late julius lulley the restaurateur who always kept a special table set for mr hoover and mr tolson at harvey once found his maryland farm dotted with fbi \"wanted\" posters bearing mr lulley picture years ago when guy hottel a hoover bodyguard and friend got married the fbi director found out where mr hottel was going on his honeymoon and conspired with the virginia state police to have the newlyweds picked up and held overnight on a fake charge mr hoover was not always quick to appreciate other people jokes in his saloon-going days in new york it was said that he avoided toots shor restaurant because of the insults that were mr shor trademark however there always was a droll undercurrent in many of mr hoover utterances--as in the w c fields-like defense of racetracks as an outlet for people emotions \"which if they weren\\'t at the track they might use for less laudable escapades\" and mr hoover recently took to public kidding about himself--the clearest sign of his rejuvenation under president nixon and attorney general john n mitchell why did he stay at a party for mr mitchell wife martha last summer mr hoover brought the house down with an impromptu speech referring to a recent life magazine cover that featured a marble bust of his bulldog face and the headline \"emperor of the fbi\" mr hoover apologized to those who did not recognize him in a tuxedo \"we emperors have our problems\" he said \"my roman toga was not returned from the cleaners\" perhaps the most widely asked question about mr hoover recently was why he stayed on the job but that too had been around a while even in the nineteen-thirties his long tenure was considered remarkable during the forties a former aide recalls \"every year he\\'d ask for a computation of his retirement and there\\'d be a rumor that the old boy was stepping down\" the inside gossip in the fifties was that mr hoover had approved plans for the construction of his retirement villa at la jolla after john kennedy reappointed mr hoover in 1960 it was thought he would bow out around the mandatory retirement age of 70 which would have come on new year day 1965 but as early as may 1964 president johnson waived the retirement law the next obvious milestone was his 75th birthday in january 1971 but that passed without incident like all the rest some people say that mr hoover wanted to see the completion of the new $102-million fbi building on pennsylvania avenue--sometime in 1974 mr hoover says he will stay on the job as long as his physical condition permitted but why \"i\\'ve always been against retiring a man by age\" he said \"the longer a man is with us the more valuable he becomes\" the men around mr hoover pointed to his egotism--a sense of his own indispensability--and to the lack of family and interests that consoled other men in retirement \"for him the bureau is everything\" said a friend',\n",
       " \"he died of heart and kidney failure said his brother stanley mr asimov was amazingly prolific writing nearly 500 books on a wide range of subjects from works for preschoolers to college textbooks he was perhaps best known for his science fiction and was a pioneer in elevating the genre from pulp-magazine adventure to a more intellectual level that dealt with sociology history mathematics and science but he also wrote mysteries as well as critically acclaimed books about the bible physics chemistry biology astronomy limericks humor shakespeare gilbert and sullivan ancient and modern history and many other subjects mr asimov first book 'pebble in the sky' ballantine a science-fiction novel was published in 1950 his first 100 books took him 237 months or almost 20 years until october 1969 to write his second 100 a milestone he reached in march 1979 took 113 months or about 9 1/2 years -- a rate of more than 10 books a year his third 100 took only 69 months until december 1984 or less than 6 years 'writing is more fun than ever' he said in a 1984 interview 'the longer i write the easier it gets' he once explained how he came to write 'asimov guide to shakespeare' crown it began he said with a book called 'words of science' ' 'science' led to 'words on the map' ' he remarked 'which took me to 'the greeks' which led me to 'the roman republic' 'the roman empire' 'the egyptians' 'the near east' 'the dark ages' 'the shaping of england' and then 'words from history' it was an easy jump to 'words in genesis' which brought on 'words from the exodus' that led me to 'asimov guide to the old testament' and then 'the new testament' so what was left except shakespeare' his usual routine was to awake at 6 am sit down at the typewriter by 7:30 and work until 10 pm in 'in memory yet green' the first volume of his autobiography published in 1979 he explained how he became a compulsive writer his russian-born father owned a succession of candy stores in brooklyn that were open from 6 am to 1 am seven days a week young isaac got up at 6 o'clock every morning to deliver papers and rushed home from school to help out in the store every afternoon if he was even a few minutes late his father yelled at him for being a folyack yiddish for sluggard even more than 50 years later he wrote: 'it is a point of pride with me that though i have an alarm clock i never set it but get up at 6 am anyway i am still showing my father i'm not a folyack' he learns to read then teaches sister isaac asimov was born jan 2 1920 in the soviet union near smolensk the son of judah and anna rachel berman asimov he was brought to the united states in 1923 and was naturalized in 1928 he taught himself to read before he was 5 years old using the signs on his brooklyn street a couple of years later with a little help from his father he taught himself to read yiddish when he was 7 he taught his younger sister to read he skipped several grades and received a high-school diploma when he was 15 after discovering science fiction on the magazine rack in his father store -- and overcoming his father objections to fanciful subject matter -- he tried writing science fiction himself and sold his first story when he was 18 the story 'marooned off vesta' ran in the october 1938 issue of amazing stories three years later in 1941 he sold a story called 'nightfall' to astounding science fiction then the top magazine in the field it was edited by john w campbell jr whose ability to find talented writers was largely responsible for what is considered the golden age of science fiction in the 1930 and 40 almost 30 years after 'nightfall' was published the science fiction writers of america voted it the best science-fiction short story ever written astounding science paid a cent a word mr asimov once recalled 'so for a 12000-word story i expected $120 i got a check for $150 and thought mr campbell had made a mistake' but when mr asimov called to tell him 'he said the story had seemed so good to him he gave me a bonus of one-quarter cent a word' mr asimov graduated from columbia university in 1939 with a bachelor of science degree and earned an ma in 1941 and a phd in chemistry there in 1948 the next year he accepted an offer from boston university school of medicine to teach biochemistry 'i didn't feel impelled to tell them that i'd never had any biochemistry' he recalled in a 1969 interview 'by 1951 i was writing a textbook on biochemistry and i finally realized the only thing i really wanted to be was a writer' he was made an associate professor of biochemistry in 1955 and a professor in 1979 although he stopped teaching in 1958 and only occasionally went back to the university to lecture a science fiction of verve and clarity mr asimov science-fiction novels and stories won many awards: five hugos given by the fans and three nebula awards given by his fellow writers his 'foundation trilogy' all published by doubleday -- which takes place in a future galactic empire and consists of 'foundation' 1951 'foundation and empire' 1952 and 'second foundation' 1953 -- was given a hugo in 1966 as best all-time science-fiction series among his nonfiction works 'asimov new guide to science' is considered one of the best books about science for the layman reviewing 'foundation edge' doubleday a sequel to the trilogy and the first of mr asimov books to make the new york times best-seller list the critic gerald jonas said in the new york times book review in 1982: 'he writes much better than he did 33 years ago -- yet he has lost none of the verve he brought to this series when he and the galaxy were much younger what more could one ask' 'foundation edge' won a hugo in 1983 as the best science-fiction novel of the year in recent years mr asimov wrote 'foundation and earth' 1986 and 'prelude to foundation' 1988 a final novel 'forward the foundation' is to be published by bantam books later this year mr asimov himself made no great claims for his work 'i make no effort to write poetically or in a high literary style' he said in 1984 'i try only to write clearly and i have the very good fortune to think clearly so that the writing comes out as i think in satisfactory shape' 'i never read hemingway or fitzgerald or joyce or kafka' he once wrote 'to this day i am a stranger to 20th-century fiction and poetry and i have no doubt that it shows in my writing' no typist or agent and no airplanes he wrote his first drafts on his typewriter and short articles and final drafts on a word processor and he rewrote everything only once 'it not out of conceit' he said 'but i have lots of stuff i'm committed to write and if i linger lovingly i won't be able to write at all' not everything however fell into place easily he once did a children book in a day but the shakespeare book took two years the book he considered his favorite 'murder at the aba' 1976 a mystery novel in which he himself was a character took seven weeks; 'the gods themselves' 1972 a science-fiction novel that won both the hugo and the nebula awards took seven months 'i do all my own typing my own research answer my own mail' mr asimov once said 'i don't even have a literary agent this way there are no arguments no instructions no misunderstandings i work every day sunday is my best day: no mail no telephones writing is my only interest even speaking is an interruption' although he wrote about space travel through countless universes and light years mr asimov himself refused to fly 'isaac says that he loves to fly into space and span the galaxies' the editor ben bova once remarked 'but only in his imagination' among mr asimov other well-known science-fiction works were 'i robot' 1950 in which he invented his famous three laws of robotics which govern the relation of robots to their human masters: robots may not injure a human or by inaction allow a human to be harmed; robots must obey humans' orders unless doing so conflicts with the first law; robots must protect their own existence unless doing so conflicts with the first two laws robot and galactic-empire themes eventually expanded and intertwined in 14 novels secret of success: it all in the genes he also wrote many nonfiction works and magazine articles on a wide range of subjects and was the editorial director of a magazine named after him -- isaac asimov science fiction magazine -- for which he wrote the editorials in each issue he received the james t grady award of the american chemical society in 1965 and the american association for the advancement of science-westinghouse science writing award in 1967 recently mr asimov said he had had a prostate operation and was cutting back on his writing he suspended his monthly column in fantasy and science fiction magazine to which he had contributed some 400 columns and articles over 33 years writing 10 or more books a year was standard procedure for mr asimov and he continued his busy pace after a heart attack in 1977 and triple bypass surgery in 1983 'i have been fortunate to be born with a restless and efficient brain with a capacity for clear thought and an ability to put that thought into words' he once remarked 'none of this is to my credit i am the beneficiary of a lucky break in the genetic sweepstakes' mr asimov once told an interviewer about sadly contemplating death and the end of conscious thought but he said he cheered himself with the thought that 'i don't have to worry about that because there isn't an idea i've ever had that i haven't put down on paper' mr asimov married gertrude blugerman in 1942; they were divorced in 1973 in addition to his brother of roslyn heights li he is survived by his wife janet jeppson whom he married in 1973; a son david of california; a daughter robyn of manhattan and a sister marcia repanes of queens from the yet to be to the long ago isaac asimov a self-confessed compulsive writer produced nearly 500 books on a remarkable array of subjects reaching out not only to distant galaxies but also to the distant past for inspiration here is a small sampling of his prodigious output\",\n",
       " 'the republican leader stood by his seat in the front row to the left of the center aisle years and illness had taken toll of the stout wavy-haired baker who had come to congress in the year that franklin d roosevelt moved into the white house now the face beneath the gray curls was deeply lined and there were heavy bags under the watery eyes \"his face looks like he slept in it\" a reporter had said but the voice was still the voice--modulated to the words now a whisper now a deep growl now rolling thunder--that for years had sent the cry through the press galleries \"ev up!\" mr dirksen recalled that \"bright sunny day\" in august 1945 when the bomb hatch of the enola gay opened over hiroshima and \"for the first time the whole bosom of god earth was ruptured by a man-made contrivance that we call a nuclear weapon\" \"i want to take a first step mr president\" mr dirksen said \"i am not a young man one of my age thinks about his destiny a little i should not like to have written on my tombstone he knew what happened at hiroshima but he didn\\'t take a first step\\'\" speech on amendment it was sept 19 1966 and the senate floor was not crowded for everett dirksen was to speak on his proposed amendment to the constitution to permit prayers in public schools he called down the wrath of god on the ministers priests and rabbis--\"social engineers\" he termed them--who opposed his amendment \"i think of the children\" he whispered \"the millions whose souls need the spiritual rehearsal of prayer\" his voice rose in scorn \"imagine the chicago bears football team made up of green inexperienced unpracticed and unrehearsed players undertaking a game against the cleveland browns it would be unthinkable because they have not been disciplined by practice    mr president the soul needs practice too it needs rehearsal\" these two speeches encompass--but do not entirely explain--that remarkable political phenomenon everett mckinley dirksen republican of illinois he could aspire to the heights climb them and take the long view without regard to party and apparently without regard to his political fortune but he could also descend into bathos there were some who believed that he figured it that way and not entirely cynically--that what he lost by espousing the nuclear test-ban treaty or the civil rights bill he recovered by apostrophes to the flag and motherhood at a $100-a-plate dinner in chicago in april 1966 he brought tears and certainly votes when he intoned: \"no you can\\'t eat freedom or buy anything with it you can\\'t hock it downtown for the things you need when a baby curls a chubby arm around your neck you can\\'t eat that feeling either or buy anything with it but what in this life means more to you than that feeling or your freedom\" mr dirksen spent most of his adult life under the dome of the united states capitol after 16 years in the house he served since 1951 in the senate and as republican leader since 1959 talent for compromise he was the very archetype of the politician with all the politician shortcomings and virtues inconstant often too apt in expedient he was found in the course of his career on both sides of almost every question but he also had the talent for compromise adjustment and conciliation that is the secret of effective government under the american system furthermore he loved the processes of politics--the wiles the guile the wheelings and dealings even its fustian but he almost always stopped short of cant in a senate increasingly composed of drab machine-tooled men mr dirksen remained an original a throwback to the more colorful less inhibited politics of the midwest at the turn of the century from boyhood his ear was enraptured by the rolling phrase the well-turned apothegm and he rarely let a day pass without rolling or turning one of his own sometimes they were 100-proof corn but often they deserved a place in a political bartlett thus his lapidary \"the oil can is mightier than the sword\" captures in eight words the essence of the democratic process the comic spirit nestled in his locks but it was the spirit of broad country humor rather than city wit like lincoln he loved to make his point with anecdote it was these qualities that explained his warm friendship with presidents as different as john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson even though he delighted in needling both on one occasion during his absence in a hospital three republican bills were narrowly defeated on his return he said: \"to my bedridden amazement my pajama-ruffled consternation yes my pill-laden astonishment i learned they were victims of that new white house telephonic half-nelson known as the texas twist\" because he was such an unabashed sentimentalist and ham some set him down as a fraud at worst or a buffoon at best he was neither he was naturally a ham and he enjoyed the role but he also stood outside himself while he played it he was a political satirist and he did not spare himself more than being himself he relished being a caricature of himself mr dirksen was by nature kind and understanding but he could cut a senator down for a breach of courtesy or an unfair attack once after senator thomas j dodd a notable absentee from the floor rolled in late in the day and demanded that majority leader mike mansfield \"behave like a leader\" mr dirksen dismissed \"the brave crusader from the nutmeg state\" as suffering from \"cerebral incoherence\" partisanship fades after he became republican leader in 1959 much of the old partisan spirit seemed to evaporate from mr dirksen it was true that the times had changed that mr dirksen himself was at last freed from the pressures both of campaigning and ambition for higher office nevertheless he seemed to realize that now that he had became leader his responsibilities lay with the national party and not to its right wing and with the presidency regardless of its occupant he did loyally support barry goldwater in 1964 but he confided to friends that he had little stomach for the assignment he did do conservative battle against many new frontier and great society domestic programs and he resisted controls over his favored drug industry but on the great issues in international affairs the nuclear test-ban treaty the vietnam war and the most seminal in domestic affairs the 1964 civil rights act and the 1965 voting rights act mr dirksen gave presidents kennedy and johnson indispensable support keenly aware of their dependence on his help and grateful for it the two democratic presidents made much of the senate minority leader calling him frequently to the white house to solicit his advice mr dirksen who was not without vanity basked in this attention this vanity was undoubtedly wounded when with richard m nixon in the white house he discovered that he was not the \"mr big\" he had been under democratic administrations son of german settlers everett dirksen and his twin brother tom were born jan 4 1896 in pekin ill then a farm-belt community of about 5000 people near peoria the parents johann frederick and antje conrady dirksen were german settlers who continued to speak their ostfriesian dialect at home when everett was 5 his father had a crippling stroke and died four years later everett and his brothers helped their mother milk the cows slop the six hogs then the 150 chickens and the 15 stands of bees and plant and weed the vegetables they sold milk eggs and produce in 191[missing text] he enrolled at the university of minnesota as a pre-law student to pay his fees he worked as an ad-taker at the minneapolis tribune as a lawyer assistant and in a railroad office in 1917 young dirksen quit the university just short of a degree to enlist in the army on the united states entry into world war i sent to france in may 1918 he became--as he later described his service--a \"gas-bag man\" from a tethered hydrogen-filled balloon 3500 feet above the lines observed and corrected artillery fire he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the field and was discharged in october 1919 returning to pekin he invested in a new washing machine business which failed from 1922 to 1925 he was general manager of a dredging company then he and his brothers bought a wholesale bakery business it succeeded in 1927 he was elected to the part-time position of city commissioner of finance and he began to have visions of a political career but he also developed writer itch and became stage-struck over the years he wrote five novels and more than 100 short stories--all unpublished he and an old schoolmate hubert ropp collaborated on writing and producing community plays mostly with chinese themes the dirksen-ropp team also produced percy mackaye \"a thousand years ago\" during the town centennial celebration mr dirksen played the lead who captured the heart of the princess of pekin played by louella carver the stage romance became a real one and in 1927 they were married two years later they had a daughter danice joy she is married to howard h baker jr now republican senator from tennessee in the 1930 primaries mr dirksen challenged the incumbent republican congressman william e hull he lost by 1100 votes and immediately began campaigning for 1932 whisky-making pekin had been hurt by prohibition in 1932 mr dirksen who had once orated against drink attacked mr hull for voting for a bill to strengthen the prohibition amendment mr dirksen got the nomination in the campaign for the general election he urged economic reforms to combat the depression--without being too specific he won by 23147 votes from then on all was clear sailing he was regularly returned with large majorities up to 1946 as soon as he arrived in washington in 1933 mr dirksen demonstrated that capacity for work and attention to legislative detail that characterized him up to the time of his death even during extended periods of illness above all he set out to be a good committeeman he went home each night with a bulging briefcase and arose every morning at 5:30 he completed his law degree by going to night school during his first four terms in the house he voted against many new deal measures including public housing rural electrification and the tennessee valley authority but he supported enough of them--including social security 1935 and the minimum wage 1938--to be accused of \"me-tooism\" by what he later called the \"hard-bitten republicans\" back home in foreign policy mr dirksen began as a stanch isolationist he voted against the reciprocal trade act in 1934 and again in 1940 in september 1940 three months after the fall of france he voted against the first peace-time conscription in united states history in february 1941 he opposed the first lend-lease bill in august 1941 only four months before pearl harbor when extension of the draft cleared the house by 203 to 202 mr dirksen voted against it a month later however he began to veer around he urged his fellow republicans to show \"a unity of purpose\" behind the president to do otherwise he said \"could only weaken the president position impair our prestige and imperil the nation\" in october 1941 he voted for additional lend-lease funds hoped for nomination in 1944 mr dirksen had hopes of second place on the ticket but thomas e dewey the republican presidential nominee chose john w bricker of ohio mr dirksen did not forgive or forget one morning in 1947 mr dirksen then 51 awoke to find his right eye clouded his doctors diagnosed the trouble as a degeneration of the retina possibly caused by cancer specialists recommended removal of the eye but after \"weeping and praying\" he decided against it but the eye required rest and mr dirksen retired from the house at the end of 1948 and did not seek re-election after 10 months of rest and medication the eye gradually recovered its vision in 1950 the illinois voters sent mr dirksen back to washington as a senator but it was a different dirksen who took his seat in january 1951 the korean war was on and he had hitched his wagon to the ill-fated presidential star of senator robert a taft of ohio during the fight at the 1952 convention over whether a pro-taft delegation from georgia or one favoring general of the army dwight d eisenhower should be accredited mr dirksen went to the rostrum and in full view of millions of watchers on television addressed himself to the new york delegation led by governor dewey and eisenhower strategist \"when my friend tom dewey was the candidate in 1944 and 1948\" he cried \"i tried to be one of his best campaigners and you ask him whether or not i didn\\'t go into 18 states one year and 23 states the next re-examine your hearts before you take this action [voting against the taft delegation] because\"--and here he pointed his finger at mr dewey--\"we followed you before and you took us down the path to defeat!\" nominating speech in his speech nominating mr taft he gave what turned out to be a preview of much of the eisenhower campaign he said: \"once it was deemed to be the primary duty of government to keep the nation at peace in the last 20 years those in power have given us the biggest costliest bloodiest war in the history of christendom they have given us more they have given us an undeclared unconstitutional one-man war in korea now in its third year it has become an inferno for the holy blood of american youth as one korean gi put it \\'we can\\'t win we can\\'t lose we can\\'t quit\\' he might have added \\'we can only die\\'\" the chill of mr taft loss of the nomination was deep in mr dirksen bones and even after his leader death in july 1953 he followed a taft course voting to slash president eisenhower foreign aid requests and to override his opposition to the bricker amendment as senate wrath slowly mounted against senator joseph r mccarthy mr dirksen went to the defense of the wisconsin republican and fought doggedly to prevent his censure in 1954 after president eisenhower re-election mr dirksen got on the team \"change\" he was fond of saying \"is an inherent way of life\" in 1959 senate republicans with the general approval elected mr dirksen minority leader and he fell to with a will \"when you carry the flag you carry the flag\" he said \"i am of the stuff which cries \\'chief hand me the red-hot poker!\\'\" three great reversals with some but not much poetic license the chicago sun-times once charged mr dirksen with changing his mind 62 times on foreign policy 31 times on defense policy and 70 times on farm legislation as he got older such chidings had all the effect--as he was to say of a kennedy program--\"of a snowflake on the bosom of the potomac\" mr dirksen probably assured himself a place in the history books by three great reversals over three years--on the united nations bond issue of 1962; the nuclear test-ban treaty of 1963 and the civil rights act of 1964 he began by taking a jaundiced view of the administration request for authority to purchase united nations bonds to make up deficits resulting largely from the refusal of the soviet union and france to pay peace-keeping assessments but on april 5 1962 he rose and admitted that he had done some soul-searching he said: \"mr president i will not charge my conscience with any act or deed which would contribute to the foundering of the united nations because i do not know how i would then be able to expiate that sin of commission to my grandchildren\" the bill passed 70 to 22 with 22 republicans voting for and 11 against mr dirksen opposition to the test-ban treaty would have made ratification uncertain at the outset he was against it the pressure on him was great--40000 letters and petitions containing 10000 names in opposition to the treaty but in studying the treaty he became convinced that his fears had been based on misunderstanding he knew from his mail that millions probably shared the same misunderstanding in handwritten notes to president kennedy he set forth questions on which senators wanted assurance and suggested that the president send a communication to majority leader mansfield and himself clarifying issues raised by the critics the president did so on sept 11 mr dirksen rose and said that he had found that his earlier opinions \"did not stand up\" he read the president letter and he said: \"mr president  this is a first single step    but with consummate faith and some determination this may be the step that can spell a grander destiny for our country and the world if there be risks mr president i am willing to assume them for my country\" the treaty was approved 80 to 19 with 25 republicans voting for it and against the illinois chapter of republican women passed a resolution condemning him and the chicago tribune asked \"is dirksen going soft\" in the past mr dirksen had supported civil rights bills but these had been anti-lynching anti- poll tax or suffrage measures such as the 1957 and 1960 acts the 1964 bill however as it came from the house aroused great doubts in him with his highly developed sense of property rights he was particularly worried about giving the federal government the power to enforce nondiscrimination in public accommodations and jobs on march 26 1964 he opened an attack on the bill saying \"they are remaking america and you won\\'t like it\" he proceeded to tear the bill apart but two months later on may 26 he told the chair he was presenting \"an amendment in the nature of a substitute\" for the house bill which had been shaped \"on the anvil of controversy and discussion\" with the justice department and the civil rights coalition he hoped it would command enough support to make closure possible and thus permit a vote his greatest shift between those two dates mr dirksen had gone through his greatest reversal and managed to carry most of his republican colleagues with him he insisted that actually \"they\"--the justice department--had come around to him attorney general nicholas b katzenbach the administration liaison with mr dirksen said mr dirksen had been \"reasonable\" in insisting on only minimal changes in the public accommodations and fair employment sections the senate imposed closure by a vote of 71 to 29 four more than the necessary two-thirds mr dirksen had corralled 27 out of 33 republican votes mr dirksen in explaining to reporters why he was fighting for the bill he had violently attacked only two months before said: \"on the night victor hugo died he wrote in his diary: \\'stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come\\'\" in 1965 mr dirksen after again extracting adjustments from the administration led the battle for the voting rights act but even as he reached the height of his career and was being heralded for his statesmanship he began to divert his energies into causes that many believed to be not only backward-looking but futile thus he fought and lost battles to stay federal court orders on reapportionment of state legislatures; to enact a constitutional amendment that would overturn the supreme court one- man one-vote decision by permitting apportionment of one house of a state legislature on a nonpopulation basis and to pass a school prayer amendment to the marigold inconstant in so many large things mr dirksen was ever constant to the marigold which he sought to make the national flower and which he grew profusely in his garden at leesburg va but he was also a sophisticated gardener as those knew who saw him at his florida home in debary mulching his prize roses and fragile camellias and nursing his red and white poinsettias to bring them to their best for christmas mr dirksen last years were burdened with illness and injury--duodenal ulcers chronic emphysema a cracked vertebra from a violent fit of coughing a broken hip he wore a steel brace on his back and hobbled for months on crutches he never complained and he refused to believe that the ills of the flesh would be cured by mortifying it when a caller seeing a glass of whisky in one hand and a cigarette in the other said he thought the senator had given them up on his doctor orders he growled: \"i have given up nothing\" the truth was not always in everett dirksen but the juices of life and humanity flowed strong in him to the end',\n",

rayburn will go down in history as one of the strong speakers but also as a parliamentary leader who relied mainly on persuasion and almost never on raw power to achieve his aims a man of taciturn dignity and no talent or envy for polished oratory he occasionally was able to swing a close vote in the house by one of his infrequent and characteristically brief speeches more often however he made his influence felt by private contact with members personally and through a dozen or so democratic lieutenants including several senior committee chairmen and several younger members with whom he consulted and worked closely his main weapons for enforcing party discipline did not derive from the fixed power of speakership much of which had been stripped away in the 1910 revolt against the \"czarism\" of speaker cannon they came rather from the inherent authority of the speaker as his party principal house leader to influence committee assignment and otherwise to advance or retard the legislative and political careers of party members he used these weapons sparingly and subtly--too much so to please some of the more liberal members of the democratic party too often in their estimation the legislative product reflected unnecessary compromises and accommodation with a coalition of republicans and southern democrats a powerful force with which mr rayburn had to contend throughout his tenure as speaker but many impartial students of government held that the rayburn technique was far more productive than an authoritarian uncompromising or militantly partisan approach would have been mr rayburn himself put the matter this way: \"you cannot lead people by trying to drive them persuasion and reason are the only ways to lead them in that way the speaker has influence and power in the house in carrying out his philosophy of leadership mr rayburn drew on vast reserves of personal friendships and loyalties among colleagues in both parties other helpful assets included a reputation for unswerving veracity massive integrity and consistent fairness a personality devoid of pretension and a relaxed sometimes earthy sense of humor throughout his public career mr rayburn held in testy contempt all efforts to classify his political philosophy as conservative liberal moderate or by any other such term \"i always say without prefix without suffix and without apology that i am a democrat\" he explained in an interview as a democrat he prided himself on his ability to follow as well as to lead he followed the leadership of president woodrow wilson in his early years in congress he followed that of presidents franklin d roosevelt in the new deal harry s truman in the fair deal and john f kennedy on the new frontier he often said that \"you can\\'t be a leader and ask other people to follow you unless you know how to follow too\" and his standard advice to first-term members of congress was: \"if you want to get along--go along\" he adhered to that precept from the start of his own first term in the house on march 4 1913 and soon came to be regarded as one of the newly inaugurated president wilson bright young men spurred new deal laws as chairman of the house interstate and foreign commerce committee from 1931 to 1937 mr rayburn was the house sponsor and manager of new deal regulatory measures that evoked some of the most bitter controversy of the period these included the securities act of 1933 to prevent fraud in the sale of stocks and bonds; the securities exchange act of 1934 and the public utility holding company act of 1935 with its \"death sentence\" clause for the utility trusts he also sponsored a bill that established the rural electrification administration over the years of loyal support for democratic principles mr rayburn occasionally excused himself from the rule of party regularity when democratic policies conflicted with what he conceived to be his responsibility as a representative from the fourth congressional district of texas he opposed president truman for example in supporting legislation to relieve natural-gas producers of strict federal price regulation he felt that the economy of his state was largely contingent upon the financial well-being of the gas and oil-producing industry mr truman vetoed the bill with an eye to the economic interests of texas mr rayburn also saw to it that a heavy majority of members of the tax-writing house ways and means committee opposed repeal or reduction of tax allowances for the depletion of oil and gas reserves for liberal trade policies at the same time however he consistently promoted liberal foreign trade programs in his selections for membership on the same committee despite strong protectionist pressure from texas oil and gas interests democratic committee assignment almost invariably went to trusted advocates of a foreign economic policy favoring low tariffs and minimum restrictions on the international exchange of goods while mr rayburn always disavowed any political aspirations beyond the house speakership a few of his closest intimates suspected that he sometimes entertained hopes of becoming president one of them pointed out recently that his boyhood goal had been set after he had studied the career of james k polk of tennessee the only house speaker in history to move along to the presidency in 1940 shortly before mr rayburn was first elected speaker the suspicions were substantiated by his obvious availability for the democratic vice-presidential nomination but at the democratic convention president roosevelt telephoned him and said: \"sam i want you to do me a great favor i want you to make the seconding speech for henry wallace [as vice president]\" mr rayburn loyally carried out the assignment mr rayburn became democratic majority leader in the house in january 1937 in that post and subsequently as speaker he carried the major responsibility for house approval of the roosevelt administration legislative program opposed by isolationists there was a crucial test of his leadership on aug 12 1941 fewer than four months before pearl harbor when isolationists came within one vote of blocking extension of the military draft speaker rayburn was instrumental in mustering the 203-202 majority for passage of the extension bill and was suspected of wielding a quick gavel to bar any motion to reconsider the vote during the truman administration mr rayburn helped to win congressional approval of the marshall plan and other foreign-policy and defense legislation sought by the president before and during the korean conflict the housing act of 1949 and the far-reaching expansion and liberalization of the social security system in 1950 were among the major fair deal laws for which he worked he also stood by president truman in opposing the taft-hartley labor law of 1947 which the republican- controlled eightieth congress enacted over mr truman veto with democrats in control of congress for the last six of dwight d eisenhower eight years as president speaker rayburn shared the congressional leadership with his close friend and protege from texas mr johnson who was majority leader of the senate on most domestic issues and nearly all foreign questions the rayburn-johnson policy was marked by conciliation and compromise and occasionally by partisan challenge to the republican president the result was the enactment of the substance of much of the eisenhower administration legislative program opposed white house throughout the roosevelt and truman years mr rayburn had consistently opposed the white house on a few big issues one was the proposed passage of legislation to enforce the civil rights of negroes president eisenhower recommendations however were less offensive to his old south background partly at senator johnson inducement he cooperated in the 1957 enactment of the first major civil rights bill since the reconstruction era a second civil rights bill likewise based on president eisenhower recommendations was enacted in 1960 again with speaker rayburn cooperation both measures were designed mainly to protect the voting rights of negroes in the south the session of 1960  a presidential election year found senator johnson seeking the democratic nomination with speaker rayburn active backing a by-product was the attempted passage of a five-part package of social legislation that was opposed strongly by the eisenhower administration and conservatives in congress the idea was to sharpen the issues and give the national democratic ticket a record on which to run in november it entailed a radical departure from the established johnson -rayburn policy of compromise and conciliation and it pleased those democrats who had long been agitating for a more militantly liberal and partisan congressional leadership as july and the national political conventions approached only one of the five bills had got though congress it called for federal loans and grants for redevelopment of the country chronically depressed areas president eisenhower vetoed that measure and congress failed to override him the other bills calling for a higher minimum wage with broader coverage health care for the aged under social security federal aid for school construction and expanded housing programs had been stalled by conservative forces then senator johnson and speaker rayburn surprisingly decided to take the step of recessing congress over the conventions instead of adjourning it for the year a hectic politics-ridden post-convention session failed to revive any of the bills the debacle was especially embarrassing to the democratic party because mr kennedy its presidential nominee and mr johnson his running mate were personally involved in key senate roles speaker rayburn with president kennedy support consequently set out early in 1961 to gain control of the house rule committee by enlarging its roster to fifteen the effort entailed what probably was the most critical test of the texan leadership in all his years as speaker his continued prestige and power were at stake and to a great extent so was the bulk of the new president legislative program in the ensuing struggle severe demands were made on party loyalty and heavy political pressures were exerted by rayburn lieutenants and the white house to bring about a 217-to-212 house vote for the enlargement plan two regular democrats and one republican were added to the rules committee presumably giving the rayburn-kennedy forces control by an 8-to-7 margin the committee was cooperative as liberal housing depressed-area redevelopment and minimum-wage legislation was sped through congress fairly early in the session a hitch developed however when president kennedy broad program of federal aid to education came before the rules committee one of the panel veteran democratic regulars representative james j delaney of queens joined the conservatives to bring about an 8-to-7 vote against the legislation mr delaney a roman catholic representing a congressional district composed mainly of catholics complained that the legislation discriminated against parochial schools while much legislation to extend and enlarge accepted liberal programs was passed speaker rayburn and president kennedy could not overcome conservative forces in the house to win approval of many broad new concepts designed to meet the great social economic and foreign- policy challenges of the nineteen sixties the hard fights of this year apparently sapped mr rayburn strength with a painful back ailment that had deprived him of much sleep the speaker left washington for rest at his bonham tex home weeks before adjournment of the session he looked wan then and tired for the first time in the memory of his oldest friends he had never before left the scene of legislation battle before the fighting had ended mr rayburn formal name which he never used was samuel taliaferro rayburn he was born in eastern tennessee near kingston in roane county of scottish-irish descent his father was william marion rayburn a farmer and confederate cavalryman his mother was the former martha waller of virginia sam was the eight of their eleven children when he was 5 the family moved to fannin country in north texas where the father bought a forty-acre cotton farm the boy worked in the cotton rows from the time the family settled there and attended a one-room school at near-by flag springs mr rayburn recalled years later having ridden ten miles on horseback to hear representative joseph weldon bailey deliver a three-hour oration mr bailey aspired to the speakership but never won it mr rayburn said he believed the speech reinforced his own boyhood decision to seek the office when he was 18 with $25 in his pocket he went to the town of commerce and attended e l mayo normal school now east texas state college he worked his way through by ringing the college bell sweeping out classrooms making fires and doing other odd jobs he took a year out to teach school at bonham and to finance his final term at mayo where he received a bachelor of science degree after two more years as a country school teacher mr rayburn was elected to the texas house of representatives in 1906 it was the first of a string of twenty-eight campaigns without a defeat three were for the texas legislature and twenty-five for congress at the age of 29 he was elected speaker of the texas house and held the post for the last two years of his six-year tenure elected to congress at 30 while a member of the legislature he studied law a the university of texas and was admitted to the bar he was 30 when first elected to congress in 1912 in 1927 mr rayburn married matze jones of valley view tex they separated almost immediately and the marriage was dissolved a year later mr rayburn subsequently lived a bachelor life but contrary to some reports it was not a lonely one a moderate drinker he enjoyed parties and accepted many invitations particularly if the event was to be a small dinner where politics would be the main conversational topic it was an almost daily ritual for him to \"visit with\" a few close friends as he put it in a hideaway that he maintained on the ground floor of the capitol harry s truman as a senator and later as vice president was a fairly regular participant in these late-afternoon sessions of relaxed conversation scotch bourbon and branch water he was called away from one of them by an urgent telephone message from a presidential aide he hurried to the white house and was informed that mr roosevelt had died and he was to be sworn in immediately as president mr rayburn maintained a two-room apartment near dupont circle in northwest washington he sometimes cooked suppers of chili and hot tamales for a few guests he usually had breakfast sent to the apartment from near-by french restaurant but insisted on american-style fare--orange juice bacon shirred eggs and honey nearly always he lunched at the house restaurant at the capitol and often was host to small groups in the speaker dining room there walked for exercise in earlier years mr rayburn made a practice of walking the two miles or so from his apartment to the capitol later he usually rode in a chauffeur-driven limousine supplied by congress but he made a special effort to find some time during the day to stroll around the capitol grounds he was a believer in the health benefits of outdoor walking and he enjoyed it too he loved to fish and spent many week-ends at near-by fishing retreats of friends and was regarded as an excellent fly and bait caster according to associates he was also a fine golfer before giving up the same some years ago mr rayburn did not affiliate with any religious denomination until late in life and never did attend church services regularly he had often said that he would like to belong to the primitive baptist church of which his father was a member this is a small fundamentalist sect without ties to larger baptist organizations in the fall of 1956 mr rayburn joined the primitive baptist church at tioga tex at the age of 74 he was \"immersed\" or baptized by the church lay minister there the speaker always maintained the closest ties with his many nieces nephews brothers and sisters whenever a brother or sister came to washington he would insist on turning over his bedroom to the guest and sleeping on a temporary bed in the living room despite a back ailment he slept on the temporary bed for several months this year while his brother and sister-in-law mr and mrs dick rayburn of ector tex occupied the bedroom their son tom rayburn was in a washington hospital for an intestinal operation they wanted to move to a hotel but speaker rayburn put his foot down one of his aides finally became concerned over the speaker loss of sleep and weight and urged him to permit the dick rayburns to take another apartment mr rayburn let loose a strong of expletives before making a final ruling that cut off further debate \"i\\'m not going to have them staying anywhere else they\\'re my family!\" besides his brother there are two other members of mr rayburn immediate family his two sisters were at his bedside when he died they are mrs w a thomas of dallas and mrs s e bartley of bonham dick rayburn was unable to reach the hospital when congress adjourned mr rayburn would lose no time getting back to bonham where he lived with a sister in a spacious white house that to him was \"prettier than mount vernon\" the speaker maintained a 250-acre farm and a 900-acre ranch he was proud of his fine herd of polled hereford cattle and was known to predict unerringly which ones would be prize winners at livestock shows on the white-pillared portico of his house fourteen rocking chairs always stood ready to receive constituents and friends who desired to \"visit with\" the congressman the sam rayburn library in bonham a $500000 marble structure was one of the speaker greatest satisfactions he started a fund for its construction in 1949 by donating a $10000 prize he had received for distinguished service to the country it contains his files and mementos as part of a collection of american historical and biographical data mr truman dedicated it in 1957 as a research center for students of democratic government as a boy and for much of his life mr rayburn was a prodigious reader of american history and biography george washington thomas jefferson james madison abraham lincoln and robert e lee were perhaps his favorite figures of american history presidents truman and roosevelt among contemporaries were also high on his list mr rayburn and general eisenhower were old acquaintances but never close friends mr rayburn pride in the house of representatives and the capitol was almost proprietary any reference to the house as \"the lower chamber\" invariably brought an angry rejoinder he insisted that the house in fact as well as in law was co-equal with the senate he actually thought it was superior \"i\\'d rather be speaker of the house than any ten senators\" he would say one of the few matters in which he was accused of being arbitrary was his ruling against the use of television cameras in the house chamber except for ceremonial sessions or in the committee rooms he believed that the effect would be to lower the dignity of the house critics of the controversial rebuilding of the east front of the capitol recently completed accused the speaker of being arbitrary and stubborn in going ahead with the project over their objections he serenely ignored them until one suggested in print that \"mr sam must think he own the capitol\" the speaker was furious and made his feeling known to a reporter many months later however he was admiring the completed project and called the same reporter attention to some gleaming marble on the house wing that had been sand-blasted from a dull gray to its original luster \"how do you like my capitol now\" he asked',\n",
       " 'adolph zukor who made entertainment history in 1912 when he offered the american public its first feature-length film died at his century city apartment in los angeles yesterday he was 103 years old mr zukor \"took a nap and died at 4 o\\'clock in the afternoon\" according to a spokesman for the paramount pictures corporation of which mr zukor served as chairman of the board emeritus after helping to build the film empire the death was attributed to natural causes adolph zukor was the completely atypical movie tycoon--unflamboyant deliberate mild-mannered predictable almost self-effacing while other pioneers in the motion picture industry such as dw griffith samuel goldwyn and louis b mayer with their well-publicized feuds rages and personal eccentricities became celebrities almost as well-known as the stars who appeared in their films mr zuker could have been mistaken for an ordinary businessman like the fur merchant he once was or perhaps a banker but mr zukor who preferred to work from behind the scenes was a true visionary who shrewdly saw well before most others did that the motion picture could become the great mass entertainment and artistic medium that it is today his fascination with and confidence in the movies went back to a day in 1901 when he stood on tiptoe he was 5 feet 5 inches tall in front of a penny arcade peepshow machine and viewed his first movie a two-minute reel called \"fun in a boarding house\" in 1903 scarcely a decade after the motion picture had been invented mr zukor invested in a union square penny arcade featuring movie peepshows and in 1912 he made entertainment history when he daringly offered the american public its first feature-length film \"queen elizabeth\" staring sarah bernhardt by the mid-twenties mr zukor had become president of the giant movie production and distribution empire known today as the paramount pictures corporation \\'look ahead a little\\' it was his policy as he put it to \"look ahead a little and gamble a lot\" on the future of the movie business as recently as 1953 when he was 80 years old and hollywood was morbidly worried that its most feared enemy television would put it out of business mr zukor sounded a confident visionary note \"rather than lose the public because television is here\" he asked \"wouldn\\'t it be smart to adopt television as our instrument\" which of course is precisely what happened in the next decade mr zukor view of his success was disarmingly simple \"i had vision--calculated vision--and the circumstances were fortunate\" he said late in 1968 in an interview for this article \"i wanted to be a merchant when i was a boy and that is what i am now and always have been--a merchant\" had he not wanted so much to be a merchant mr zukor might very well have become a rabbi \"i had the devil of a time persuading my uncle kalman liebermann who was a rabbi himself that i wasn\\'t cut out for the theological calling\" he said mr zukor was born in riese hungary; on jan 7 1873 his father jacob who operated a general store in the small village of thatched-roof huts died when he was a year old and his mother the former hannah liebermann died when he was 7 adolph and a brother arthur who did become a rabbi went to live with their uncle kalman started at $2 a week when he was 16 yeas old and with $40 sewed into the lining of his overcoat adolph zukor arrived at the immigration center at castle garden in new york harbor his first job was sweeping the floor in a fur store and he was paid and he was paid $2 a week but he soon learned to be a fur cutter and was making $4 in 1892 mr zukor bought a $10 railroad ticket to chicago where he went into the fur business with a new york acquaintance morris kohn then as in later life mr zukor was a bit on the shy side preferring to stay in the shop to do the cutting while mr kohn solicited orders for furs the business prospered while in chicago mr zukor met lottie kaufman and married her in 1897 they had two children eugene who became a paramount executive in 1916 and mildred the zukors and mr kohn moved their fur business to new york in 1900 and in 1903 joined with mitchell mark in the operation of a penny arcade in a former butcher shop on 14th street at union square the automatic vaudeville company as it was called soon opened branches in philadelphia boston and newark with new capital furnished by marcus loew another fur merchant who eventually was to become president of loew inc parent company of metro-goldwyn-mayer pictures the penny arcades offered a variety of entertainment machines including phonographs with individual listening devices and movie peepshows that featured brief storyless films mr zukor becoming increasingly fascinated with anything having to do with motion pictures began in 1906 plowing his profits from the arcades into hales\\' tours a venture that proved disastrous in small theaters built to simulate railroad coaches travelogues were projected on a screen accompanied by recordings of train whistles rumbling wheels and ringing bells \"the illusion was created among the spectators that they were traveling through the country they viewed on the screen\" mr zukor recalled years later \"it was a good business for a time but the novelty soon wore off and we lost a lot of money--myself and some friends in the fur trade i eventually reimbursed all of them\" the touring cars were converted into nickelodeon theaters which because they offered longer larger moving pictures than the penny arcades were becoming increasingly popular \"you have to understand\" mr zukor explained years later \"what was happening in this country to see why movies were catching on from 1900 to 1910 about nine or ten million immigrants poured in and because nickelodeon movies were new cheap silent and set up no language difficulties they became a popular pastime\" as treasurer of loew enterprises mr zukor helped forge a chain of about two dozen nickelodeon houses and the company expanded into actual theater operations by converting fur shops bakeries and clothing and other stores into movie exhibition halls the films available for the movie houses were severely limited both in number and in quality however because the motion picture industry at the time was controlled by a trust it was not broken in fact until 1915 through sherman act litigation in 1912 mr zukor resigned from loew enterprises because he said \"i was restless and impatient to produce full-length classical plays which i believed would be the real future of films\" edison aid enlisted he interested daniel frohman a broadway producer in the idea mr frohman persuaded thomas alva edison a member of the film trust to get the trust assurance that no legal obstruction would be erected to prevent mr zukor and mr frohman from exhibiting a feature-length film having learned that american rights to \"queen elizabeth\" starring sandra bernhardt at the time the most famous actress in the world were available for a $35000 investment in the production of the french-made feature the two partners closed the deal and rented the lyceum theater to present the film the night of july 12 1912 was a historic one for the motion picture industry the elite of the theater world and society figures who would not have been caught viewing a movie then considered a vulgar form of entertainment attended the premiere of \"queen elizabeth\" the movie lasted only 40 minutes but it has been considered the first feature-length film to be shown in america it was of incredibly poor quality and the camera was not kind to the aging miss bernhardt who had to hobble through her scenes on a wooden leg but if bernhardt was willing to make movies the fashionable crowd apparently concluded then movies had arrived the lyceum resounded with cheers mr zukor gamble had paid off \"queen elizabeth\" was the first film to be shown around the country on a \"roadshow\" or reserved-seat basis and it made about $200000 for mr zukor and mr frohman who formed the famous players film company to produce according to their motto \"famous plays with famous players\" \\'monte cristo\\' a success the company first picture in 1913 was \"the count of monte cristo\" starring a rather corpulent james o\\'neill it was a huge success and the feature picture sweepstakes with new companies sprouting up almost daily was on the first of the new companies to merge with mr zukor was the jesse l lasky feature picture play company which had produced the first made in hollywood movie \"the squaw man\" directed by cecil b demille shoved out of the merged concern in the process was samuel goldwyn later to become a legendary hollywood producer mr zukor continued to engineer mergers and consolidations the paramount pictures corporation was formed to distribute films made by famous players-lasky and a dozen smaller companies pulled into mr zukor corporate giant the consolidations led to formation of a nationwide film distribution system and in 1919 the company bought 135 theaters in the southern states making the producing concern the first that guaranteed exhibition of its own product in its own theaters theater chain grew mr zukor by then turning out 60 features a year made deals to show them all in theaters controlled by loew enterprises and he continued to add more theaters to his own chain by 1920 he was in a position to charge what he wished for film rentals and he developed the concept now the accepted practice in the film industry by which the distributor charges the exhibitor a percentage of box-office receipts over objections of his board of directors mr zukor bought a huge plot of ground at broadway and 43d street to build the paramount theater and office building a 39-story monument to himself that had its grand opening in 1926 his private of-[missing text] mr zukor was primarily a businessman he did not take the same personal down-to- the-last-detail interest in the making of his movies that producer-executives such as samuel goldwyn and louis b mayer did he spent most of his time in new york but

north of new city ny in rockland county he lived there for 30 years until shortly after the death of his wife in 1956 variety of nicknames around paramount mr zukor was known by a variety of nicknames ranging from \"sugar\" which zukor means in hungarian to \"uncle adolph\" to \"creepy\" the last- named because he moved so lithely and silently that he tended to startle people mr zukor had a deft way of handling artistic temperament in the mid-twenties for example when gloria swanson was paramount reigning star he imported the popular polish-born actress pola negri the two prima donnas loathed each other mr zukor solved the problem he said years later \"by keeping the two ladies a continent apart-- swanson at the studios in astoria queens and negri in hollywood\" for years mr zukor was forced to renegotiate mary pickford contract every time miss pickford heard that rudolph valentino who starred for mr zukor in \"the sheik\" had gotten a salary raise at one point miss pickford told mr zukor: \"you know for years i\\'ve dreamed of making $20000 a year before i was 20 and i\\'ll be 20 very soon\" \"i could take a hint\" mr zukor recalled wryly \"she got the $20000 and before long i was paying her $100000 a year mary was a terrific businessman\" miss pickford had a stage mother who could upstage all stage mothers and on one occasion mr zukor had to write into a pickford contract a clause that provided the star mother $25000 for her \"moral support\" it was worth it he said later because \"little mary made us some millions\" mr zukor became paramount board chairman in 1935 but in recent years had the titles honorary chairman and chairman emeritus he never lost interest in making--and saving- -money for paramount in recent years mr zukor spent the winter months in

freely 'no one' he told an interviewer in 1990 'had ever been so high and fallen so low' mr nixon political life spanned the cold war he began in politics as an ardent anti-communist and he spent his last years crusading for american political support and financial aid to boris n yeltsin russia a resignation not a confession mr nixon never received the honors and accolades he would have earned had he not resigned the presidency in the face of certain impeachment for the cover-up of a cheap political burglary of democratic offices in the watergate complex and other illegal acts of domestic espionage all documented by oval office tape recordings still he never confessed to the 'high crimes and misdemeanors' of which he was accused in articles of impeachment which were approved by the house judiciary committee and which precipitated his resignation in 1974 'when the president does it that means it is not illegal' he told david frost in a celebrated television interview three years after he was pardoned by his successor gerald r ford so strong was the stigma of the watergate scandals that it tended to obscure mr nixon accomplishments in foreign affairs these included establishing relations with communist china initiating detente and nuclear arms control treaties with the soviet union and opening the way for egypt to break with the soviet bloc and subsequently to make peace with israel in the domestic arena his record appears better through the prism of subsequent events some scholars say than it did at the time in his administration an expansion of the food stamp program went a long way toward stamping out hunger in america the environmental protection act authorized vast resources and regulations for cleaning the country air land and water in fact many of the government regulations and expenditures for social programs that ronald reagan cut when he became president in 1981 were the products of the nixon administration rather than of the democratic presidents mr reagan blamed perhaps more important was mr nixon reshaping of the supreme court through his appointment of a chief justice and three associate justices he appointed candidates for their ideological persuasion particularly on such issues as judicial restraint tough law enforcement and relaxation of school desegregation rules as a result the nine-member court was transformed from the 'liberal warren court' to a body that was often split on the great issues of the day but more attuned to conservative causes a push for peace a bungled burglary yet his accomplishments were marred to some extent by his methods his motives and his ambiguities carrying out the 'peace with honor' agreement to end the long divisive war in southeast asia took five years from the time he was elected to office on a peace pledge years in which american society was scarred by riots and rebellions against the efforts to force peace through bombings and incursions into new territory by the end of 1968 30610 americans and untold vietnamese had died in the war; over the next five years another 27557 americans and even more vietnamese died the men who negotiated the peace henry a kissinger and le duc tho were selected for the nobel peace prize; mr tho declined in all matters mr nixon centralized power in himself and a few aides in the white house and sought to broaden the authority of the executive branch at the expense of congress and the courts he tried to use the bureaucracy against political foes he entered his second term by interpreting his crushing defeat of george mcgovern as a mandate to scale back domestic government even though some of the programs involved grew out of the first nixon term but that effort was barely under way early in 1973 when the watergate disclosures weakened him watergate in its broadest sense -- not only the burglary of democratic headquarters and subsequent effortsat a cover-up but also the corruption of federal agencies for illegal purposes -- had such an impact on politics and government that it remains a promontory on the landscape of american history in watergate wake congress passed a proliferation of legislation intended to restore ethics to elections and government to make government more open to the public and to restrain agencies from abusing individual rights at home and abroad citizens seemed to be so offended by watergate that for several years they voted heavily against candidates of mr nixon party whether or not they had anything to do with the scandals a result democrats swept congress in 1974 and jimmy carter was elected president in 1976 the contest between mr carter and president ford was so close that many students of politics believed mr ford would have won had he not pardoned mr nixon an act that prevented the kind of criminal prosecution that sent many nixon aides to prison it was mr nixon personality and character that most caught the attention of americans as always accompanied by controversy he went from southern california to the house of representatives to the senate to the white house as dwight d eisenhower vice president to the presidency and to private citizen as the first president to have resigned the office in years between he was defeated in a race for the presidency by john f kennedy in 1960 and two years later in a bid for governor of california by edmund g pat brown no public figure had been more observed discussed and psychoanalyzed in public yet few professed to understand him 'though he was a remote and private man we had all been drawn into his life story' garry wills author of 'nixon agonistes' wrote after the resignation 'decade by decade crisis by crisis we were unwilling intruders on his most intimate moments -- we saw him cry sweat tremble saw him angry hurt vindictive the tapes even let us eavesdrop on those embarrassing conversations although no one really knew him we all knew too much about him he was too vividly present and yet not present at all -- a collection of quirks and not a person; a conspicuous absence' on another level there were those who asserted that the apparent nixon enigma stemmed not from his character but from his fruitless efforts as president to persuade the people to take a more pragmatic view of government particularly in foreign affairs a view that neither the right nor left was quite prepared to adopt calling the nixon era 'a golden age of diplomacy' william tucker a writer and magazine editor wrote in 1981: 'the nixon approach was always hated by the far left and far right -- groups that despite doctrinal differences see the world in terms of absolute right and wrong the right hated nixon because he had abandoned the anti-communist cause; the left was unforgiving of the former richard nixon and resentful because he turned out to be such a constructive diplomat watergate had little to do with it' americans did not know who richard nixon was in part because he had no fixed ideology no particular place on the political spectrum he was a loner who had no lasting alliances with other prominent republican leaders at one time or another he was at cross-purposes with dwight eisenhower barry goldwater nelson rockefeller ronald reagan earl warren and others his life was a series of contradictions he preached the protestant ethic of hard work and moral living and was prim in dress and manner yet the white house tapes that came to light in the watergate investigation as well as the testimony of some of his associates showed that he could be profane amoral and power-driven a faith of peace a policy of force reared as a quaker mr nixon said he was strongly influenced by that faith of peace and contemplation yet he considered politics combat and election campaigns an 'arena' a foundation of his foreign policy was to appear ready to use military force anywhere in the world like lincoln and jackson he identified with the common people siding with 'middle america' against the well-to-do but his own style of living was extravagant with two expensive homes in california and florida subsidized by wealthy friends and the federal government he entered the white house promising to decentralize authority but almost immediately consolidated it in himself and a few aides at the expense of his cabinet he invited crises and until the watergate scandals closed in thrived on them but he felt depressed after a victory as he wrote in his book 'six crises' he entered politics by falsely branding his opponent for a house seat as an ally of communists and their sympathizers yet as president he opened relations with the communist government of china and established a rapport with soviet and other communist-bloc leaders that no previous president had achieved some nixon observers have sought to explain him as an early practitioner of 'the new politics' in which the dominant ingredients are a weak party structure and the mass appeal of television california set the trend there mr nixon was able to run for congress without working his way up through party ranks as was the custom in most other states in 1946 six years later mr nixon discovered in his celebrated 'checkers' speech that on television he could move audiences without being subjected to questions and checking of his facts thereafter he used television whenever he could and became a master of the controlled broadcast that conveyed the image he desired none of this however explains richard nixon he was a man of enormous complexity many volumes have been written about him in an effort to penetrate his core he himself provided the best clues 'they'll never give us credit' kenneth w clawson was communications director for mr nixon and a loyalist who stayed with him to the end shortly after mr nixon resigned and returned to san clemente calif he sent for mr clawson who had grown up in appalachia and admired the nixon style and determination mr clawson found 'the old man' depressed and nursing a bout of phlebitis his legs propped on his desk 'they'll never give us credit' he said to mr clawson who wrote of the conversation in the washington post in 1979 'even now they try to stomp us you know kick us when we're down they'll never let up never because we were the first threat to them in years and by god we would have changed it all changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years if only   ' there was no explanation of who 'they' were and no need for one they were the liberals the intellectuals journalists those born to privilege the anti-nixon people in his own party those mr nixon had counted as his enemies over many years 'what starts the process really are the laughs slights and snubs when you are a kid' mr nixon said 'sometimes it because you are poor or irish or jewish or catholic or ugly or simply that you are skinny but if you are reasonably intelligent and if your anger is deep enough and strong enough you learn you can change those attitudes by excellence personal gut performance while those who have anything are sitting on their fat butts 'once you learn that you've got to work harder than anybody else it becomes a way of life as you move out of the alley and on your way in your own mind you have nothing to lose so you take plenty of chances and if you do your homework many of them pay off it is then you understand for the first time that you really have the advantage because your competitors can't risk what they have already it a piece of cake until you get to the top you find you can't stop playing the game the way you've always played it because it is a part of you and you need it as much as an arm and a leg' patting his swollen leg he added: 'so you are lean and mean and resourceful and you continue to walk on the edge of the precipice because over the years you have become fascinated by how close to the edge you can walk without losing your balance this time there was a difference this time we had something to lose' that short conversation provides a thread that ran through mr nixon entire life a life lived on the precipice and for the most part sustained by skill determination and a good bit of luck early years quaker church football field role in war taste of politics the future president was born jan 9 1913 in yorba linda calif then a farming community of 200 people near los angeles his ancestors on both sides were farmers artisans and tradesmen who came to america from ireland in the 18th century francis anthony nixon richard father was born on a farm in ohio left home at the age of 14 to earn a living and arrived in california several years later in 1907 he found a job as a trolley-car motorman in the quaker community of whittier where he met hannah milhous whose family had come there from indiana in 1897 frank and hannah were married in 1908 after working in his father-in-law orchards and in several other jobs frank bought a general store and filling station in 1922 richard was the second of five sons 'it was not an easy life but it was a good one' richard nixon recalled in his memoirs 'centered around a loving family and a small tight-knit quaker community' childhood friends of mr nixon said he rarely smiled in 'the presidential character' published in 1972 james david barber cited a 'lifelong propensity for feeling sad about himself with his duke law school roommate observation that 'he never expected anything good to happen to him or to anyone else close to him unless it was earned' ' he daydreamed of faraway places; worked hard at winning good grades in school; lectured his brothers to be more conscientious; played football with zest even though he was not good at it; pursued music acting and debating and competed for leadership positions in school and went four times a week to a strict quaker church he was close to death and illness at an early age a younger brother arthur died of tubercular encephalitis when richard was 12 when richard was 20 his older brother harold died of tuberculosis after a 10-year illness that drained the family resources at the age of 3 richard toppled from a horse-drawn buggy and the wheel ran over his head inflicting a deep gash in his scalp that left an ugly scar 'out of his childhood nixon brought a persistent bent toward life as painful difficult and perhaps as significant uncertain' mr barber wrote some students of his career concluded that as an adult mr nixon would make his investment in life not in values but in managing himself so he could accomplish his next goal and in the process he was not as enigmatic as he was often pictured rather his behavior was consistent with his view of the world and was perhaps more predictable than that of most politicians after he had become famous and served as vice president his mother was asked if her son had changed over the years 'no' she replied 'he has always been exactly the same i never knew a person to change so little' the upward ladder: fighting to win after graduation from high school the young nixon wanted to go to harvard or yale but there was no money for that so he stayed four more years in the community he wished desperately to escape and entered whittier college there he sharpened his debating talents was elected president of the freshman class and of the student body for three years and took acting lessons but it was his football coach wallace newman who influenced him the most 'i admired him and learned more from him than any man i have ever known aside from my father' mr nixon said in his memoirs he said of mr newman 'he had no tolerance for the view that how you play the game counts more than whether you win or lose he used to say 'show me a good loser and i'll show you a loser' ' graduating from whittier second in his class mr nixon won a scholarship to the duke university law school in durham nc there he was so short of spending money that he spent most of his time in study he was elected president of the duke bar association and graduated third in his class mr nixon tried to get a job in one of the big new york law firms particularly sullivan & amp; cromwell but he received no encouragement the federal bureau of investigation also turned him down he went back to california and was admitted to the bar in november 1937; he almost immediately joined the firm of wingert & amp; bewley in whittier in his spare time he became active in civic groups taught sunday school and acted in a little theater group it was in the theater that he met thelma catherine ryan called pat because she was born march 16 a day before st patrick day in 1912 when they met she was teaching typing and shorthand at whittier high school they were married two years later june 21 1940 in a quaker ceremony when the united states entered world war ii in 1941 mr nixon took a job in washington as a lawyer with the office of price administration an experience he loathed and would cite in later years as evidence of the failure of government bureaucracy after seven months he applied for and was granted a navy commission he became an operations officer with the south pacific combat air transport command charged with establishing cargo bases a politician is born midwifed by committee at war end he was surprised to receive a letter from a committee of california republicans asking if he was interested in running for congress although there had been little indication that mr nixon had wanted to make politics his career he jumped at the chance the five-term incumbent was jerry voorhis a liberal in the truman tradition who had voted for federal control of tidelands oil and had worked for cheap credit and for public power; the conservatives of southern california wanted him out mr nixon returned to california and in competing with other candidates for the committee endorsement said the issues would be 'new deal government control in regulating our lives' versus 'individual freedom and all that initiative can produce' 'i hold with the latter viewpoint' he said 'i believe that returning veterans and i have talked to many of them in the foxholes will not be satisfied with a dole or a government handout' that mr nixon had little opportunity for contact with servicemen in the foxholes was not important; he demonstrated a political ability to say what his audience wanted to hear he won the committee endorsement and the primary but when the campaign for the 1946 general election began mr nixon was far behind his opponent to overcome that he developed a technique he would use time and again: discredit your opponent mr nixon issued a statement billing himself as a 'clean forthright young american who fought for the defense of his country in the stinking mud and jungles of the solomons' while his opponent tayed safely behind the front in washington' this was coupled with another statement saying he represented no special interest or pressure group and adding in reference to the political action committee of the congress of industrial organizations: 'i welcome the opposition of the pac with its communist principles and huge slush fund' mr voorhis defense that the pac had not endorsed him and that it was not communist did not deter mr nixon and when he arrived in washington at the age of 34 representative nixon received a cold shoulder from some members of congress who believed he had unseated a colleague unfairly the slight did not escape the notice of mr nixon who was already beginning to see himself confronted by enemies fame and alger hiss politics and the pink lady it was the alger hiss case that made richard nixon a national celebrity in august 1948 mr hiss a highly regarded former state department official was accused by whittaker chambers a former communist and then a senior editor at time magazine of having given mr chambers secret government documents for delivery to the soviet union in 1937 and 1938 mr hiss denied the charges before the house committee on un-american activities and swore he did not know 'a man named whittaker chambers' because of mr hiss excellent credentials and government record the matter might have been dropped had mr nixon not doggedly pursued it as head of a special subcommittee mr hiss finally acknowledged that he had known mr chambers as 'george crosley' a freelance writer he had befriended in the 1930 he continued to deny however that he had been a communist or had passed secret documents after mr hiss filed a libel suit against mr chambers the rumpled rotund editor produced from a pumpkin on his maryland farm five rolls of microfilm of documents that he said had been passed to him by mr hiss they led to mr hiss indictment on a charge of perjury and after two trials he was convicted in 1950 the episode was an embarrassment to democrats who had defended mr hiss mr nixon won wide praise for his persistence and astuteness in the case but he emphasized the enemies he made 'the hiss case proved beyond any reasonable doubt the existence of soviet-directed communist subversion at the highest levels of american government' mr nixon wrote in his memoirs 'but many who had defended hiss simply refused to accept the overwhelming evidence of his guilt some turned their anger and frustration on me' the hiss case made richard nixon famous but it also turned him he wrote 'into one of the most controversial figures in washington bitterly opposed by the most respected and influential liberal journalists and opinion makers of the time' in 1950 senator sheridan downey a democrat unexpectedly chose to retire mr nixon who had had his eye on the senate seat for a couple of years was supported by major california newspapers and was unopposed in the republican primary the democrats however were split in a bitter primary contest in which representative helen gahagan douglas emerged the winner to face representative nixon mrs douglas was a former broadway and motion picture actress who was married to the actor melvyn douglas she was a popular liberal a fair dealer who had enthusiastically supported the truman program from the beginning mr nixon set out to discredit his opponent loyalty to the american system he distributed more than half a million pink fliers that said in part: 'during five years in congress helen douglas has voted 353 times exactly as has vito marcantonio the notorious communist party-line congressman from new york how can helen douglas capable actress that she is take up so strange a role as a foe of communism and why does she when she has so deservedly earned the title of 'the pink lady'' in fact mrs douglas was denounced by pro-communist groups as a 'capitalist warmonger' and it was in this campaign that mr nixon was first called 'tricky dick' an epithet bestowed by the independent review in an editorial and picked up by mrs douglas in her campaign the extreme charges against mrs douglas turned out to be overkill: mr nixon won the race by 680000 votes but the campaign would supply democrats with anti-nixon ammunition for years to come national scene a young man and a war hero: a gop ticket with balance it seemed strange to some that dwight eisenhower a war hero running for president as a moderate picked richard nixon as his running mate in 1952 but politically it made sense eisenhower was reputed within the party to be the candidate of the 'eastern liberal establishment' he needed someone from the west or middle west who could appeal to disappointed conservatives further the retired general knew as mr nixon later wrote 'that to maintain his above-the-battle position he needed a running mate who was willing to engage in all-out combat and who was good at it' and in many ways mr nixon himself projected a moderate image as a spokesman against corruption in government at 39 he was young bright and an effective speaker he first caught the attention of eisenhower supporters in addressing a republican dinner in new york three months before the nominating convention former gov thomas e dewey of new york twice the party presidential nominee and eisenhower chief backer was reported to have told mr nixon after his speech: 'make me a promise don't get fat don't lose your zeal and you can be president some day' a speech about checkers a spot secured the 1952 campaign was barely under way when on sept 18 a sudden crisis loomed the new york post and other newspapers disclosed that 78 wealthy california businessmen had quietly raised a fund of $18235 to defray political expenses for senator nixon although establishment of such a fund would later seem mild the news at the time stunned much of the country many democrats and some republicans including eisenhower closest advisers demanded that mr nixon resign from the ticket on ethical grounds eisenhower himself was silent for several days finally saying only: 'nothing decided nixon has got to be clean as a hound tooth' each wanted the other to make the decision after mr nixon told the general by telephone that it was time for the head of the ticket to make a decision the eisenhower people were convinced that mr nixon had to go but the general gave him the opportunity to state his case on national television by any measure his defense was a virtuoso performance he maintained that he had done nothing wrong disclosed his mortgages and other financing to show he was in fact in debt attacked communism and asked people to tell the republican national committee whether they thought he should resign his most moving and best remembered remarks were in reference to his wife and a dog named checkers 'pat and i have the satisfaction that every dime that we've got is honestly ours' he said 'i should say this -- that pat doesn't have a mink coat but she does have a respectable republican cloth coat' then he said a man in texas had given the family a cocker spaniel 'black and white and spotted' 'and our little girl tricia the 6-year-old named it checkers and you know the kids love the dog and i just want to say this right now that regardless of what they do about it we're going to keep it' public response was overwhelmingly pro-nixon eisenhower asked him to meet him on the campaign trail in wheeling wva when the nixon plane landed the general hopped aboard 'general you didn't need to come out to the airport' the surprised mr nixon said 'why not' said the general flashing his famous grin 'you're my boy' after the republican victory mr nixon turned out to be an active vice president under a president who preferred to operate quietly president eisenhower was willing to delegate more tasks than most of his predecessors and the energetic mr nixon had a knack of keeping himself in the limelight no manner how menial the assignment probably his most important role was in foreign affairs he visited 56 countries as a good-will envoy but more important he served on the national security council at the heart of policy decisions and intelligence he was close to secretary of state john foster dulles whose policy of 'brinksmanship' fit perfectly with mr nixon idea of bold and even risky actions abroad mr nixon travels abroad generated far more news than most trips by vice presidents unlike most he was not content to engage in ceremony and quiet diplomacy he invited crowds to engage him in dialogue however tense relations might be between their country and his thus mr nixon 1958 trip in south america turned out to be one of the 'six crises' he would recall in his book he managed sessions of crowd-mingling and argumentative discussion in venezuela and argentina with few problems but in peru crowds of students and others had been worked into an anti-yankee anti-nixon frenzy by speakers and signs 'are you afraid of the truth' when a rock thrown from a crowd in lima grazed the vice president neck and hit a secret service agent in the teeth mr nixon shook his fist at the crowd and asked 'are you afraid to talk to me are you afraid of the truth' he leapt onto the trunk of his car shouting: 'cowards! are you afraid of the truth' in a later confrontation someone spat in his face 'i felt an almost uncontrollable urge to tear the face in front of me to pieces' he wrote later 'i at least had the satisfaction of planting a healthy kick on his shins nothing i did all day made me feel better' such confrontations paid off in public acclaim on his return to the united states he was greeted by cheering crowds as a conquering hero and there was the celebrated 'kitchen debate' with the soviet leader nikita s khrushchev while mr nixon was on a trip to moscow in 1959 to open an american exhibit at a fair in the kitchen of a model home the two leaders engaged in a folksy dialogue on the relative merits of the capitalist and soviet systems the two men stood jowl to jowl the soviet leader occasionally jabbing mr nixon chest for emphasis the outcome was inconclusive of course but mr nixon won acclaim at home for the forceful manner in which he defended the american system there were also attacks from his opponents frequent herblock cartoons in the washington post showed him with a shadowy hateful face; some showed him climbing out of a sewer to give a campaign talk the duke faculty voted 61 to 42 against giving mr nixon an honorary degree richard nixon could never give up politics however he had tasted power and the excitement of living on the precipice and he liked it pat nixon though she would still try to persuade him to retire from politics resigned herself year after year to 'another campaign' aiming higher one ballot four debates two defeats and a recovery after the eisenhower-nixon ticket won again in 1956 by a wide margin defeating adlai e stevenson for a second time mr nixon groomed himself for the 1960 presidential nomination a rival gov nelson a rockefeller of new york abandoned his efforts after mr nixon popularity shot up in the wake of the 'kitchen debate' the republicans nominated mr nixon on the first ballot at their convention in chicago trying to appeal to the 'eastern establishment' he chose henry cabot lodge of massachusetts as his running mate the democratic ticket was senator john f kennedy of massachusetts and senator lyndon b johnson of texas the campaign went badly from the beginning for the first time in his career mr nixon was on the defensive forced to defend the eisenhower record and to erase his reputation as an unfair campaigner eisenhower who had always had trouble embracing mr nixon did not help at a news conference he was asked for an example of a major idea of mr nixon that had been adopted by the administration 'if you give me a week i might think of one' he replied 'i don't remember' and the nixon campaign itself was in many ways uncharacteristic mr nixon who had always seemed prepared to take on any opponent anywhere held senator kennedy and his family in awe in a way few of his supporters could understand he admired the kennedy family fighting spirit and their wealth and status whatever the reason he broke from his practice and never made a slashing attack on his opponent a noted debater he was not at his best in the four television debates with mr kennedy he was tense and he declined the use of makeup: his dark beard and pasty forehead with beads of sweat made him appear on television to be the shadowy figure that cartoonists had depicted throughout the campaign the vice president serious sometimes prim demeanor was overshadowed by the charisma of the young senator this seemed more important than questions about an interest-free $205000 loan from howard hughes to mr nixon brother donald or such issuesas which candidate would be toughest against the russians and which could in mr kennedy words 'get this country moving again' in the wake of a recession a quiet pledge: 'i would be back' still mr nixon campaigned as doggedly as he ever had and the outcome was extraordinarily close in the popular vote mr kennedy led by 113000 out of 688 million cast it was mr nixon first defeat and the last he would accept graciously many republicans believing that democratic machines in chicago and texas had stolen the election for mr kennedy wanted to contest the outcome but mr nixon would not in his memoirs he wrote that on the night of mr kennedy inauguration when happy democrats were celebrating throughout washington he went alone to the deserted capitol and stood for several minutes on a balcony overlooking the snow-covered mall and the washington monument 'as i turned to go inside i suddenly stopped short struck by the thought that this was not the end that someday i would be back here i walked as fast as i could back to the car' at the age of 48 mr nixon returned to california and entered the 1962 race for governor against the incumbent pat brown a democrat seeking a second term it was another tumultuous campaign of charges and countercharges but in the end the voters seemed to recognize what mr nixon admitted in his memoirs: he did not really want to be governor; he wanted to be president the night of his defeat he was in a foul mood mr nixon felt he had been abused by the press and when reporters kept insisting that he make a statement he marched into the press room and made an angry farewell-to-politics speech that included the line 'you won't have nixon to kick around anymore because gentlemen this is my last press conference' almost everyone believed that his political career was over he had violated a basic rule of american politics: never appear to be a poor loser but after that night he began a slow measured recovery that would lead to victory in two presidential elections he wrote in his memoirs: 'i have never regretted what i said in 'the last press conference' i believe that it gave the media a warning that i would not sit back and take whatever biased coverage was dished out to me i think the episode was partially responsible for the much fairer treatment i received from the press during the next few years from that point of view alone it was worth it' ever restless he moved to new york as a senior partner in a wall street law firm whose name became nixon rose guthrie anderson & amp; mitchell the nixons settled in an expensive apartment on fifth avenue but mr nixon spent little time as a lawyer rather he worked at becoming president the crushing defeat of its 1964 nominee barry goldwater left the republican party in a shambles and it was mr nixon who moved in and did the drudge work needed to rebuild a constituency attending the dinners the rallies the conventions in 1966 he chartered a sputtering dc-3 to take him around the country to speeches on behalf of republican congressional candidates although his plane was modest mr nixon managed to appear presidential the head of a party that was starting to capitalize on the weaknesses of the johnson administration as public opposition to the vietnam war mounted and as many people became fearful of rising crime and civil disorder on jan 31 1968 he formally announced his candidacy for the presidency he rolled easily through the primaries with the help of southern conservatives attracted by a promise that he would ease off on school desegregation he won the nomination at the party convention in miami beach on the first ballot defeating governor rockefeller of new york a liberal and governor reagan of california a conservative as in the 1950 senate race the cards fell mr nixon way president johnson withdrew as a candidate for re-election because of the opposition to the vietnam war senator robert f kennedy was assassinated in los angeles in june while campaigning for the democratic nomination vice president hubert h humphrey was nominated over an antiwar candidate senator eugene j mccarthy of minnesota at the democratic national convention in chicago while the police and demonstrators fought in the streets but mr humphrey was too closely tied to mr johnson policies for many democrats and when he finally announced his independent opposition to the war it was too late to heal the wounds millions of independents and moderates in both parties saw mr nixon as a suitable alternative to another democratic administration at the age of 55 he seemed to have put the excesses of his youth behind him his mastery of foreign affairs and the prospects that he would bring an era of reforms after years of hastily enacted 'great society' programs at home appealed to many and in 1968 he was able to control as never before the image he projected to voters by then candidates could be and were packaged and sold on television campaign tours and rallies were useful mostly for showing on tv screens the reality of a campaign could be altered to project the desired image john d ehrlichman later a top white house assistant recalled the campaign in his book 'witness to power' at an oct 31 rally in madison square garden for example nixon supporters were bused in from distant suburbs to fill the hall while those off the street who looked as if they might boo or heckle the candidate were directed down a corridor that led back to the street 'the television audience' mr ehrlichman wrote aw only the thunderous cheering of a friendly enthusiastic crowd of enlightened american voters' mr nixon won the popular vote by a narrow margin and got 301 electoral votes to 191 for mr humphrey and 46 for gov george c wallace of alabama on a third-party ticket first term more spending more control more justices more war when mr nixon became president he had never before wielded executive authority but he had been around power for so long and went to such great pains to keep abreast of affairs at home and abroad that he knew exactly what he would do much of what he did in the domestic area was aimed at cementing his re-election in 1972 several nixon aides said he began by appointing a broadly based cabinet that included elected officials like gov george romney of michigan as secretary of housing and urban development and walter j hickel the former governor of alaska as interior secretary he named daniel patrick moynihan of new york who had been a liberal in the kennedy administration as his chief urban affairs adviser and henry kissinger an adviser to governor rockefeller as his chief foreign policy aide despite his promises during the campaign and his presidency to trim government spending mr nixon presided over an expansion in spending one reason was that he had to deal with a liberal democratic congress another was that he did believe in many innovations for government aid and in the 1970 there was a strong public demand for such services he proposed a family assistance program that would have been more generous than the traditional welfare then on the books he backed safety and health protection for workers and he called for housing allowances that would have moved many families out of public housing by giving them money to rent their own his administration built more subsidized housing units than any before or since and he agreed to environmental legislation including the environmental protection act that would pour billions into cleaning up the nation air and waters although few noticed it at the time mr nixon expansion of the food stamp program would later be acknowledged as a remarkable breakthrough in social policy by a president who preached austerity: by 1982 it was helping to feed 1 in 10 americans another innovation that had an important effect on the nation was the program under which the federal government took several billion dollars each year from its tax receipts and distributed it with few strings attached to local governments looking to re-election mr nixon opted to give local officials the maximum authority over use of these revenue-sharing funds a 1972 strategy to comfort the south but much of this was little noticed at the time because of some of mr nixon positions on civil rights and his efforts to win the support of southern conservatives breaking away from the democratic party he backed off on enforcement of school desegregation supporting legislation and executive action that would vastly reduce the use of busing as the chief tool in achieving integration a cornerstone of this 'southern strategy' was his effort to change the makeup of the supreme court two conservative nominees from the south were rejected by the senate but mr nixon was still able to reshape the court with four appointments: warren e burger as chief justice and associate justices harry a blackmun lewis f powell jr and william h rehnquist in much of his presidency mr nixon faced a troubled economy and as pressure from congress and the public mounted for him to do something to check inflation he imposed wage and price controls in mid-1971 the controls required him to set up the kind of bureaucracy he had hated in world war ii and when they were lifted after the 1972 election prices shot up again 'what did america reap from its brief fling with economic controls' mr nixon asked in his memoirs 'the aug 15 1971 decision to impose them was politically necessary and immensely popular in the short run but in the long run i believe that it was wrong the piper must be paid and there was an unquestionably high price for tampering with the orthodox economic mechanisms'\",\n",

to give his daughter time to send telegrams to relatives he died at 11:30 pm 6:30 pm new york time his death was attributed to circulatory trouble brought on by his advanced age he was buried in a brief and simple ceremony early this afternoon next to an urn containing the ashes of his wife helene who died in europe in 1957 the grave on the banks of the ogooue river is marked by a cross he made himself hospital workers lepers cripples and other patients gathered in the jungle heat as the body of the noted physician scholar philosopher and musician was lowered into the ground director of the lambarene hospital has been handed over to schweitzer assistant dr walter munz schweitzer only daughter mrs rhena eckert will be its administrator lambarene was where schweitzer chose to die \"i feel at home here i belong to you until my dying breath\" he told co-workers at the sprawling hospital on his 90th birthday jan 14 he fell ill from exhaustion on aug 28 and his condition worsened steadily the family and close friends were prepared for the end in a telegram that mrs eckert sent to them from here saturday she said: \"he is dying inevitably and soon he goes quietly in peace and dignity his brother dr paul schweitzer 83 was not able to be with him he is suffering from a heart ailment reverence for life man ultimate redemption through beneficent activity--the theme of part ii of goethe \"faust\" a metaphysical poem much admired by albert schweitzer--threads through this extraordinary man long complex and sometimes curious life with faust himself he could join in saying: this sphere of earthly soilastounding plans e\\'en now are brewing:still gives us room for lofty doingi feel new strength for bolder toilthe deed is everything the glory naught \"you must give some time to your fellow man\" schweitzer counseled in paraphrase \"even if it a little thing do something for those who have need of a man help something for which you get no pay but the privilege of doing it\" also like goethe on whose life and works he was expert schweitzer came near to being a comprehensive man he was theologian musicologist organ technician physician and surgeon missionary philosopher of ethics lecturer writer and the builder and chief force of the famous hospital at lambarene in gabon the former french equatorial africa to a marked degree schweitzer was an eclectic franco-german yet cosmopolitan in culture he drew deeply from the music and philosophy of the 18th century especially bach goethe and kant at the same time he was a child of the 19th century accepting its creature comforts yet rejecting its complacent attitudes toward progress in line with the 20th century he sought to put religion on a rational footing and to accept the advances of science; yet he was a foe to materialism and to the century criteria for personal success as a person schweitzer was a curious mixture widely honored with degrees citations scrolls medals special stamps even the nobel prize for peace in 1952 he seemed oblivious to panoply he did not preen himself nor did he utter cosmic statements at the drop of a cause instead he seemed to many observers to be a simple almost rustic man who dressed in rumpled clothing suffered fools gladly stated fundamental verities patiently and paternally and worked unobtrusively in this respect he was undoubtedly made more of by cultists than he was willing to make of himself although he was by no means a man with a weak ego some of his more ardent admirers insisted that he was a jungle saint even a modern christ but schweitzer rejected such adulation; he held that his own spiritual life was its own reward and that works redeemed him in world and in god he took the search for the good life seriously for him it had profound religious implications \"anyone can rescue his human life\" he once said \"who seizes every opportunity of being a man by means of personal action however unpretending for the good of fellow men who need the help of a fellow man\" he sought to exemplify the idea that man through good works can be in the world and in god at one and the same time for all his self-abnegation schweitzer had a bristly character at least in his later years a formidable sense of his own importance to lambarene and a do-good paternalism toward africans that smacked more of the 19th than the 20th century for example john gunther got a dressing-down from schweitzer for writing that he resembled buffalo bill and also perhaps for implying that he did not know what was going on in nationalist africa if schweitzer was thin-skinned to criticism from irreverent journalists he heard little of it at lambarene where his proprietorship was unquestioned not only did he design the station but he also helped build it with his own hands his co-workers were quite familiar with the businesslike and sometimes grumpy and brusque schweitzer in a solar hat who hurried along the construction of a building by gingering up the native craftsmen with a sharp: \"allez-vous opp! allez-vous opp-opp hupp upp opp!\" when schweitzer was in residence at lambarene virtually nothing was done without consulting him once for instance he all but halted the station work when he received a letter from a norwegian child seeking a feather from parsifal his pet pelican he insisted on seeing personally that the youngster got a prompt and touching reply from his own pen before work was permitted to resume his autocracy was more noticeable as his years advanced and as his medical assistants grew less awesome of him schweitzer regarded most native africans as children as primitives it was said that he had scarcely ever talked with an adult african on adult terms he had little but contempt for the nationalist movement for his attitudes were firmly grounded in 19th-century benevolence although thousands of africans called him \"le grand docteur\" others plastered his village with signs \"schweitzer go home!\" needs held elementary \"at this stage\" schweitzer said in 1963 \"africans have little need for advanced training they need very elementary schools run along the old missionary plan with the africans going to school for a few hours every day and then going back to the fields agriculture not science or industrialization is their greatest need\" his attitude was sharply expressed in a story he liked to tell of his orange trees \"i let the africans pick all the fruit they want\" he said \"you see the good lord has protected the trees he made the africans too lazy to pick them bare\" although schweitzer views on africa were out of date he did what no man had done before him--he healed thousands and he welded world attention on africa many plights a jungle saint he may not have been; a jungle pioneer he surely was whatever schweitzer idiosyncrasies he constructed a profound and enduring ethical system expressed in the principle ehrfurcht vor dem leben or reverence of life it is conceivably the only formal philosophical concept ever to spring to life amid a herd of hippopotamuses as schweitzer recounted this climactic incident he had been baffled in getting an answer to the question: is it at all possible to find a real and permanent foundation in thought for a theory of the universe that shall be both ethical and affirmative of the world and life the answer came in a flash of mystic illumination in september 1915 as he was steaming up the ogooue river in africa late in the third day of his journey he was on deck thinking and writing \"at the very moment when at sunset we were making our way through a herd of hippopotamuses there flashed upon my mind unforeseen and unsought the phrase \\'reverence for life\\'\" \"the iron door has yielded\" he went on \"the path in the thicket had become visible now i had my way to the idea in which world [affirmation] and life-affirmation and ethics are contained side by side! now i knew that the world-view of ethical world-and- life-affirmation together with its ideal of civilization is founded in thought\" schweitzer ethical system elucidated at length in \"the philosophy of civilization\" is boundless in its domain and in its demands he summarized it once by saying: \"a man is ethical only when life as such is sacred to him that of plants and animals as that of his fellow men and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in need of help\" \"let me give you a definition of ethics\" he wrote on another occasion \"it is good to maintain and further life; it is bad to damage and destroy life and this ethic profound universal has the significance of a religion it is religion\" called upon to be specific about reverence for life he explained that the concept \"does not allow the scholar to live for science alone even if he is very useful to the community in so doing\" a guide to action schweitzer earnestly sought to live his philosophy which for him was a creedal guide to action he was genuinely proud of his medical and missionary station at lambarene he had scratched it out from the jungle beginning in 1913; he had designed it; he had worked as an artisan in constructing many of its buildings; and although the station was many times beset by adversities that would have discouraged a less dedicated man it had grown at his death to more than 70 buildings 350 beds and a leper village of 200 the compound was staffed by 3 unpaid physicians 7 nurses and 13 volunteer helpers visitors who equated cleanliness tidiness and medicine were horrified by the station for every patient was encouraged to bring one or two members of his family to cook for him in the ditches beside the wards babies even in the leper enclave dropped toys into the dust of the unpaved streets and then popped them into their mouths noisome animals wandered in and out including schweitzer pet parrot which was not taught to talk because that would lower its dignity and a hippopotamus that once invaded the vegetable garden lambarene resembled not so much a hospital as a native village where physicians cared for the sick actually schweitzer preferred and planned it in this fashion on the ground that the natives would shun an elaborate shiny and impersonal institution the compound even lacked electricity except for the operating and dental rooms and members of the staff read by kerosene lamp of course it had no telephone radio or airstrip schweitzer view that \"simple people need simple healing methods\" however it might have outraged medical sophisticates won for lambarene a tremendous measure of native confidence thousands flocked there and thousands responded to schweitzer sermons as well as to his scalpel for he believed that the good shepherd saves not only the animal but also his soul lambarene was suffused with reverence for life to what some critics thought was an exaggerated degree mosquitoes were not swatted nor pests and insects doused with chemicals; they were left alone and humans put up with them indeed building was often brought to a halt lest nests of ants be killed or disturbed on the other hand patients received splendid medical care and few seemed to suffer greatly from the compound lack of polish critic accolade schweitzer accomplishments are recognized even by his most caustic critics one of them gerald mcknight wrote in his book \"verdiot on schweitzer\": \"the temptation for schweitzer to see lambarene as a place cut off from the world in which he can preserve \"its original forms and so reject any theory of treatment or life other than his own is understandable when one considers the enormous achievement he has attained in his own lifetime he came to the ogooue in 1913 when horses drew the buses of london and leprosy was considered an incurable scourge housed originally in the grounds of a mission he chose to leave this comparative sanctuary for the unknown and forbidding regions of the jungle nearby \"no doubt a wish to have absolute dominion over his hospital drove him to this course linked with the inner purpose which had brought him to africa but it was nonetheless heroic today the hospital has grown entirely under his hand and direction into a sizable colony where between 500 and 600 people live in reasonable comfort no greater tribute to his abilities as a conqueror of jungle need be cited than the fact--regarded locally as something of a miracle--of his own survival\" schweitzer came to french equatorial africa as a tall handsome broadly powerful young man with a shock of rich black hair an enormous mustache and a look of piercing determination in his bold eyes the years thinned and grayed his hair without making it less unruly; age seamed his face shrunk his frame made him appear bandy-legged; time softened his eyes and made them less severe but determination to make his life an \"argument\" for his ethical creed was as firm at 90 as it was on his 30th birthday the day he decided to devote the rest of his life to the natives of africa as a physician schweitzer arrival at this decision was calculated a step in a quest for a faith to live by it was a search that had haunted him driven him since childhood albert schweitzer was born at kaystersberg haute alsace now haut-rhin jan 14 1875 just two months after germany had annexed the province from war-prostrate france during that year his father a lutheran pastor moved his wife and eldest son to the neighboring village of gunsbach amid the foothills of the vosges it was to this picture-book franco-german village and its vineyards that schweitzer was invariably to return between periods of self-imposed exile in africa a musical prodigy as a child he was frail and an indifferent student in everything but music for which he showed the interest of a prodigy he began to play the church organ at 8 when his feet barely reached the pedals at the age of 18 he entered the university of strasbourg as a student in theology philosophy and musical theory but this time he had also studied the organ briefly in paris under the legendary charles marie widor who was so impressed with schweitzer talents that he taught him then and later without fee indeed schweitzer became a notable organist especially in the works of bach schweitzer university life was interrupted by a year of compulsory military service in 1894 a period that proved crucial to his religious thinking and to his life vocation the moment of awakening came as he was reading matthew x and xi in greek chapters that contain jesus\\' injunctions to his apostles among them the one that commands \"heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils: freely ye have received \"freely give\"; and the verse that urges men \"take my yoke upon you and learn from me; for i am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls\" why jesus cried out schweitzer was not only struck by the application of these verses to himself but even more by the over-all content of the two chapters as expressed in jesus\\' assertion that \"the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" these chapters started a chain of thought that resulted in \"the quest for the historical jesus\" published in 1910 it at once established schweitzer as an eminent if controversial theologian whose explosive ideas had a profound influence on contemporary religious thinking schweitzer depicted jesus as a child of his times who shared the eschatological ideas of late judaism and who looked for an immediate end of the world jesus schweitzer contended believed himself the messiah who would rule in a new kingdom of god when the end came; at first jesus believed that his messianic reign would begin before his disciples returned from the teaching mission commanded of them in the gospel according to st matthew when the world end did not occur according to schweitzer view jesus decided that he must undergo an atoning sacrifice and that the great transformation would take place on the cross this too failed schweitzer argued hence the despairing cry \"my god my god why hast thou forsaken me\" \"the jesus of nazareth    who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work the final consecration never had any existence\" schweitzer wrote \"he is a figure designed by rationalism endowed with life by liberalism and clothed by modern theology in an historical garb\" schweitzer maintained nonetheless that jesus\\' concepts were eternal \"in reality that which is eternal in the words of jesus is due to the very fact that they are based on an eschatological world-view and contain the expression of a mind for which the contemporary world with its historical and social circumstances no longer had any existence \"they are appropriate therefore to any world for in every world they raise the man who dares to meet their challenge and does not turn them and twist them into meaninglessness above his world and time making him inwardly free so that he is fitted to be in his own world and in his own time a simple channel of the power of jesus\" meantime as these beliefs were maturing in schweitzer mind he continued his student life at strasbourg and fixed with great precision the course of his future in 1896 at the age of 21 he pledged himself that he would give the following nine years to science and art and then devote himself to the service of suffering humanity wrote on kant in those years he completed his doctoral thesis in philosophy a study of imanuel kant views on religion; studied the organ again with widor in paris; won his doctorate in theology; was ordained a curate; taught theology and became principal of the faculty at strasbourg; wrote \"the mystery of the kingdom of god\"; and at widor urging completed a study of the life and art of johann sebastian bach the english version \"j s bach\" is a two-volume translation of the german text itself an entire reworking of the first version written in french it approaches bach as a musician-poet and concentrates on his chorales; cantatas and passion music schweitzer presents bach as a religious mystic as cosmic as the forces of nature bach he said was chiefly a church composer as such and as a lutheran \"it is precisely to the chorale that the work of bach owes its greatness\" \"the chorale not only puts in his possession the treasury of protestant music\" schweitzer wrote \"but also opens to him the riches of the middle ages and of the sacred latin music from which the chorale itself came \"from whatever direction he is considered bach is then the last word in an artistic evolution which was prepared in the middle ages freed and activated by the reformation and arrives at its full expression in the 18th century\" turning to bach nonchurch music schweitzer said: \"the brandenburg concertos are the purest product of bach polyphonic style we really seem to see before us what the philosophy of all ages conceives as the fundamental mystery of things--that of self-unfolding of the idea in which it creates its own opposite in order to overcome it and so on and on until it finally returns to itself having meanwhile traversed the whole of existence\" bach \"well-tempered clavier\" also drew schweitzer warmest praise schweitzer probing conception of bach created a sensation in its time and it still remains a classic study not only for the detailed instructions it provides for the playing of bach but also for its challenging esthetic true to his pledge schweitzer turned from music and theology to service to others on oct 13 1905 he posted letters from paris to his parents and friends saying that at the start of the winter term he would become a medical student to prepare himself for the life of a physician in french equatorial africa this decision protested vigorously by his friends was like so many others in his life the product of religious meditation he had pondered the meaning of the parable of dives and lazarus and its application to his times and he had concluded that dives represented opulent europe and lazarus with his open sores the sick and helpless of africa explaining his decision later in more mundane terms schweitzer said: \"i wanted to be a doctor that i might be able to work without having to talk for years i had been giving myself out in words this new form of activity i could not represent to myself as talking about the religion of love but only as an actual putting it into practice\" studied medicine 7 years for seven years from 1906 until he received his md degree in february 1913 schweitzer studied medicine but he did not entirely cut himself off from his other worlds attending the university of strasbourg he served as curate at st nicholas gave concerts on the organ conducted a heavy correspondence and examined pauline ideas especially that of dying and being born again \"in jesus christ\" it resulted in a book \"paul and his interpreters\" published in english in 1912 that same year he resigned his curateship and his posts at the university and married helene bresslau the daughter of a well-known strasbourg historian a scholar herself she became a trained nurse in order to share her husband life in africa on good friday 1913 the couple set sail from bordeaux for africa where schweitzer established a hospital on the grounds of the lambarene station of the paris missionary society the society wary of schweitzer unorthodox religious views had barred him from preaching at the station but agreed to accept his medical skills lambarene on the ogooue river a few miles from the equator is in the steaming jungle its climate is among the world worst with fiercely hot days clammy nights and seasonal torrents of rain the natives have all the usual diseases plus hansen disease leprosy dysentery elephantiasis sleeping sickness malaria yellow fever and animal wounds from the first when schweitzer hospital was a broken-down hen coop natives flocked by foot by improvised stretcher by dugout canoe to lambarene for medical attention he had barely started to clear the jungle when world war i broke out he and his wife they were german citizens were interned as prisoners of war for four months then released to continue the work of the hospital in this time and the succeeding months he started to write the two-volume \"the philosophy of civilization\" his masterwork in ethics that was published in 1923 it is a historical review of ethical thought leading to his own original contribution of reverence for life as an effective basis for a civilized world schweitzer book and other writings as well disputed the theory that human progress toward civilization was inevitable he disagreed sharply with aristotle view that man knowledge of right and wrong would surely lead him to make the right choices he maintained instead that man must rationally formulate an ethical creed and then strive to put it into practice in reverence for life he concluded \"knowledge passes over into experience\" in 1917 the schweitzers were returned to france and later to alsace to support himself and to carry on the work at lambarene schweitzer joined the medical staff of the strasbourg hospital preached gave lectures and organ recitals traveled and wrote he returned to africa alone in 1925 his wife and daughter rhena who was born in 1919 remaining in europe in the almost eight years of his absence the jungle had reclaimed the hospital grounds and the buildings had to be rebuilt this was no sooner under way than schweitzer fell ill an epidemic of dysentery broke out and a famine set in the epidemic promoted schweitzer to move his hospital to a larger site two miles up the ogooue where expansion was possible and where gardens and orchards could be planted two physicians had arrived from europe and to them and to two nurses he turned over all medical responsibilities for a year and a half while he supervised and helped to fell trees clear ground and construct buildings the main hospital room and the dispensary were complete when he departed for europe in midsummer 1927 he returned to lambarene in 1929 and remained for two years establishing a pattern of work in africa and sojourns in europe during which he lectured wrote and concertized to raise funds for his hospital on one of these occasions in 1949 he visited the united states and lectured on goethe at a conference in aspen colo le mot juste hundreds flocked to hear him and to importune him on one occasion a group of tourists pulled him away from the dinner table to get an explanation of his ethics he responded with remarkable courtesy for about 20 minutes until one questioner prodded him for a specific application of reverence for life \"reverence for life\" schweitzer replied \"means my answering your kind inquiries; it also means your reverence for my dinner hour\" the tourists got the point and he returned to his meal on his trip to europe schweitzer invariably made his headquarters at his home in gunsbach which was expanded until it was also a leave and rest center for the hospital staff on an afternoon schweitzer could often be seen leaving his home to slip over to the church to play bach he played bach at lambarene too on pianos especially lined with zinc to prevent rot he not only played throughout europe but he also repaired church organs and kept up a ceaseless study of music schweitzer received many honorary degrees and recognition from a number of governments and learned societies he was made an honorary member of the british order of merit in 1955 he was elected to the french academy in 1951 after his wife died in 1957 schweitzer was almost continuously in lambarene he celebrated his 90th birthday there as hundreds of africans europeans and americans gathered to wish him well among the messages he received was one from president johnson \"in your commitment to truth and service\" the president cabled \"you have touched and deepened the live of millions you have never met\"',\n",
       " 'to many million of american negroes the rev dr martin luther king jr was the prophet of their crusade for racial equality he was their voice of anguish their eloquence in humiliation their battle cry for human dignity he forged for them the weapons of nonviolence that withstood and blunted the ferocity of segregation and to many millions of american whites he was one of a group of negroes who preserved the bridge of communication between races when racial warfare threatened the united states in the nineteen-sixties as negroes sought the full emancipation pledged to them a century before by abraham lincoln to the world dr king had the stature that accrued to a winner of the nobel peace prize a man with access to the white house and the vatican; a veritable hero in the african states that were just emerging from colonialism between extremes in his dedication to non-violence dr king was caught between white and negro extremists as racial tensions erupted into arson gunfire and looting in many of the nation cities during the summer of 1967 militant negroes with the cry of \"burn baby burn\" argued that only by violence and segregation could the negro attain self-respect dignity and real equality in the united states floyd b mckissick when director of the congress of racial equality declared in august of that year that it was a \"foolish assumption to try to sell nonviolence to the ghettos\" and white extremists not bothering to make distinctions between degrees of negro militancy looked upon dr king as one of their chief enemies at times in recent months efforts by dr king to utilize nonviolent methods exploded into violence violence in memphis last week when he led a protest march through downtown memphis tenn in support of the city striking sanitation workers a group of negro youths suddenly began breaking store windows and looting and one negro was shot to death two days later however dr king said he would stage another demonstration and attributed the violence to his own \"miscalculation\" at the time he was assassinated in memphis dr king was involved in one of his greatest plans to dramatize the plight of the poor and stir congress to help negroes he called this venture the \"poor people campaign\" it was to be a huge \"camp-in\" either in washington or in chicago during the democratic national convention in one of his last public announcements before the shooting dr king told an audience in a harlem church on march 26: \"we need an alternative to riots and to timid supplication nonviolence is our most potent weapon\" his strong beliefs in civil rights and nonviolence made him one of the leading opponents of american participation in the war in vietnam to him the war was unjust diverting vast sums away from programs to alleviate the condition of the negro poor in this country he called the conflict \"one of history most cruel and senseless wars\" last january he said: \"we need to make clear in this political year to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the united states that we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killing of vietnamese and americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self- determination in southeast asia\" object of many attacks inevitably as a symbol of integration he became the object of unrelenting attacks and vilification his home was bombed he was spat upon and mocked he was struck and kicked he was stabbed almost fatally by a deranged negro woman he was frequently thrown into jail threats became so commonplace that his wife could ignore burning crosses on the lawn and ominous phone calls through it all he adhered to the creed of passive disobedience that infuriated segregationists the adulation that was heaped upon him eventually irritated some negroes in the civil rights movement who worked hard but in relative obscurity they pointed out--and dr king admitted--that he was a poor administrator sometimes with sarcasm they referred to him privately as \"de lawd\" they noted that dr king successes were built on the labors of may who had gone before him the noncoms and privates of the civil rights army who fought without benefit of headlines and television cameras the negro extremists he criticized were contemptuous of dr king they dismissed his passion for nonviolence as another form of servility to white people they called him an \"uncle tom\" and charged that he was hindering the negro struggle for equality dr king belief in nonviolence was subjected to intense pressure in 1966 when some negro groups adopted the slogan \"black power\" in the aftermath of civil rights marches into mississippi and race riots in northern cities he rejected the idea saying: \"the negro needs the white man to free him from his fears the white man needs the negro to free him from his guilt a doctrine of black supremacy is as evil as a doctrine of white supremacy\" the doctrine of \"black power\" threatened to split the negro civil rights movement and antagonize white liberals who had been supporting negro causes and dr king suggested \"militant nonviolence\" as a formula for progress with peace at the root of his civil rights convictions was an even more profound faith in the basic goodness of man and the great potential of american democracy these beliefs gave to his speeches a fervor that could not be stilled by criticism scores of millions of americans--white was well as negro--who sat before television sets in the summer of 1963 to watch the awesome march of some 200000 negroes on washington were deeply stirred when dr king in the shadow of the lincoln memorial said: \"even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \\'we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal\\'\" and all over the world men were moved as they read his words of dec 10 1964 when he became the third member of his race to receive the nobel peace prize insistent on man destiny \"i refuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life which surrounds him\" he said \"i refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality \"i refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear destruction i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality this is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant\" for the poor and unlettered of his own race dr king spoke differently there he embraced the rhythm and passion of the revivalist and evangelist some observers of dr king technique said that others in the movement were more effective in this respect but dr king had the touch as he illustrated in a church in albany ga in 1962: \"so listen to me children: put on your marching shoes; don\\'cha get weary; though the path ahead may be dark and dreary; we\\'re walking for freedom children\" or there was the meeting in gadsen ala late in 1963 when he displayed another side of his ability before an audience of poor negroes it went as follows: king: i hear they are beating you audience: yes yes king: i hear they are cursing you king: i hear they are going into your homes and doing nasty thing and beating you king: some of you have knives and i ask you to put them up some of you have arms and i ask you to put them up get the weapon of non-violence the breastplate of righteousness the armor of truth and just keep marching\" it was said that so devoted was his vast following that even among illiterates he could by calm discussion of platonic dogma evoke deep cries of \"amen\" dr king also had a way of reducing complex issues to terms that anyone could understand thus in the summer of 1965 when there was widespread discontent among negroes about their struggle for equality of employment he declared: \"what good does it do to be able to eat at a lunch counter if you can\\'t buy a hamburger\" the enormous impact of dr king words was one of the reasons he was in the president room in the capitol on aug 6 1965 when president johnson signed the voting rights act that struck down literacy tests provided federal registrars to assure the ballot to unregistered negroes and marked the growth of the negro as a political force in the south backed by organization dr king effectiveness was enhanced and given continuity by the fact that he had an organization behind him formed in 1960 with headquarters in atlanta it was called the southern christian leadership conference familiarly known as slick allied with it was another organization formed under dr king sponsorship the student nonviolent coordinating committee often referred to as snick these two organizations reached the country though their basic strength was in the south they brought together negro clergymen businessmen professional men and students they raised the money and planned the sit-ins the campaigns for negro vote registration the demonstrations by which negroes hacked away at segregationist resistance lowering the barriers against negroes in the political economic and social life of the nation this minister who became the most famous spokesman for negro rights since booker t washington was not particularly impressive in appearance about 5 feet 8 inches tall he had an oval face with almond-shaped eyes that looked almost dreamy when he was off the platform his neck and shoulders where heavily muscled but his hands were almost delicate speaker of few gestures there was little of the rabblerouser in his oratory he was not prone to extravagant gestures or loud peroration his baritone voice though vibrant was not that of a spellbinder occasionally after a particular telling sentence he would tilt his head a bit and fall silent as though waiting for the echoes of his thought to spread through the hall church or street in private gatherings dr king lacked that laughing gregariousness that often makes for popularity some thought he was without a sense of humor he was not a gifted raconteur he did not have the flamboyance of a representative adam clayton powell jr or the cool strategic brilliance of roy wilkins head of the national association for the advancement of colored people what dr king did have was an instinct for the right moment to make his moves some critics looked upon this as pure opportunism nevertheless it was this sense of timing that raised him in 1955 from a newly arrived minister in montgomery ala with his first church to a figure of national prominence bus boycott in progress negroes in that city had begun a boycott of buses to win the right to sit where they pleased instead of being forced to move to the rear of buses in southern tradition or to surrender seats to white people when a bus was crowded the 381-day boycott by negroes was already under way when the young pastor was placed in charge of the campaign it has been said that one of the reasons he got the job was because he was so new in the area he had not antagonized any of the negro factions even while the boycott was under way a board of directors handled the bulk of administrative work however it was dr king who dramatized the boycott with his decision to make it the testing ground before the eyes of the nation of his belief in the civil disobedience teachings of thoreau and gandhi when he was arrested during the montgomery boycott he said: \"if we are arrested every day if we are exploited every day if we are trampled over every day don\\'t ever let anyone pull you so low as to hate them we must use the weapon of love we must have compassion and understanding for those who hate us we must realize so many people are taught to hate us that they are not totally responsible for their hate but we stand in life at midnight; we are always on the threshold of a new dawn\" home bombed in absence even more dramatic in some ways was his reaction to the bombing of his home during the boycott he was away at the time and rushed back fearful for his wife and children they were not injured but when he reached the modest house more than a thousand negroes had already gathered and were in an ugly mood seeking revenge against the white people the police were jittery quickly dr king pacified the crowd and there was no trouble dr king was even more impressive during the \"big push\" in birmingham which began in april 1963 with the minister at the limelight negroes there began a campaign of sit-ins at lunch counters picketing and protest marches hundreds of children used in the campaign were jailed the entire world was stirred when the police turned dogs on the demonstrators dr king was jailed for five days while he was in prison he issued a 9000-word letter that created considerable controversy among white people alienating some sympathizers who thought dr king was being too aggressive moderates called obstacles in the letter he wrote: \"i have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the negro great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the white citizens counciler or the ku klux klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice\" some critics of dr king said that one reason for this letter was to answer negro intellectuals such as the wrier james baldwin who were impatient with dr king belief in brotherhood whatever the reasons the role of dr king in birmingham added to his stature and showed that his enormous following was deeply devoted to him he demonstrated this in a threatening situation in albany ga after four negro girls were killed in the bombing of a church dr king said at the funeral: \"in spite of the darkness of this hour we must not despair we must not lose faith in our white brothers\" as dr king words grew more potent and he was invited to the white house by president kennedy and johnson some critics--negroes as well as white--noted that sometimes despite all the publicity he attracted he left campaigns unfinished or else failed to attain his goals dr king was aware of this but he pointed out in 1964 in st augustine fla one of the toughest civil rights battlegrounds that there were important intangibles \"even if we do not get all we should\" he said \"movements such as this tend more and more to give a negro the sense of self-respect that he needs it tends to generate courage in negroes outside the movement it brings intangible results outside the community where it is carried out there is a hardening of attitudes in situations like this but other cities see and say: \"we don\\'t want to be another albany or birmingham\\' and they make changes some communities like this one had to bear the cross\" it was in this city that negroes marched into the fists of the mob singing: \"we love everybody\" conscious of leading role there was no false modesty in dr king self appraisal of his role in the civil rights movement \"history\" he said \"has thrust me into this position it would be both immoral and a sign of ingratitude if i did not face my moral responsibility to do what i can in this struggle\" another time he compared himself to socrates as one of \"the creative gadflies of society\" at times he addressed himself deliberately to the white people of the nations once he said: \"we will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering we will meet your physical force with soul force we will not hate you but we cannot in all good conscience obey your unjust laws  we will soon were you down by our capacity to suffer and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process\" the enormous influence of dr king voice in the turbulent racial conflict reached into new york in 1964 in the summer of that year racial rioting exploded in new york and in other northern cities with large negro populations there was widespread fear that the disorders particularly in harlem might set of unprecedented racial violence at this point dr king became one of the major intermediaries in restoring order he conferred with mayor robert f wagner and with negro leaders a statement was issued of which he was one of the signers calling for \"a broad curtailment if not total moratorium on mass demonstrations until after presidential elections\" the following year dr king was once more in the headlines and on television--this time leading a drive for negro voter registration in selma ala negroes were arrested by the hundreds dr king was punched and kicked by a white man when during this period of protest he became the first negro to register at a century-old hotel in selma martin luther king jr was born jan 15 1929 in atlanta on auburn avenue as a child his name was michael luther king and so was his father his father changed both their names legally to martin luther king in honor of the protestant reformer auburn avenue is one of the nation most widely known negro sections many successful negro business or professional men have lived there the rev martin luther king sr was pastor of the ebenezer baptist church at jackson street and auburn avenue young martin went to atlanta morehouse college a negro institution whose students acquired what was sometimes called the \"morehouse swank\" the president of morehouse dr b e mays took a special interest in martin who had decided in his junior year to be a clergyman he was ordained a minister in his father church in 1947 it was in this church he was to say some years later: \"america you\\'re strayed away you\\'ve trampled over 19 million of your brethren all men are created equal not some men not white men all men america rise up and come home\" before dr king had his own church he pursued his studies in the integrated crozier theological seminary in chester pa he was one of six negroes in a student body of about a hundred he became the first negro class president he was named the outstanding student and won a fellowship to study for a doctorate at the school of his choice the young man enrolled at boston college in 1951 for his doctoral thesis he sought to resolve the differences between the harvard theologian paul tillich and the neo-naturalist philosopher henry nelson wieman during this period he took courses at harvard as well while he was working on his doctorate he met coretta scott a graduate of antioch college who was doing graduate work in music he married the singer in 1953 they had four children yolanda martin luther king 3d dexter scott and bernice in 1954 dr king became pastor of the dexter avenue baptist church in montgomery ala at that time few of montgomery white residents saw any reason for a major dispute with the city 50000 negroes they did not seem to realize how deeply the negroes resented segregated seating on buses for instance revolt begun by woman on dec 1 1955 they learned almost by accident mrs rosa parks a negro seamstress refused to comply with a bus driver order to give up her seat to a white passenger she was tired she said her feet hurt from a day of shopping mrs parks had been a local secretary for the national association for the advancement of colored people she was arrested convicted of refusing to obey the bust conductor and fined $10 and cost a total of $14 almost as spontaneous as mrs parks act was the rallying of many negro leaders in the city to help her from a protest begun over a negro woman tired feet dr king began his public career in 1959 dr king and his family moved back to atlanta where he became a co-pastor with his father of the ebenezer baptist church as his fame increased public interest in his beliefs led him to write books it was while he was autographing one of these books \"stride toward freedom\" in a harlem department store that he was stabbed by a negro woman it was in these books that he summarized in detail his beliefs as well as his career thus in \"why we can\\'t wait\" he wrote: \"the negro knows he is right he has not organized for conquest or to gain spoils or to enslave those who have injured him his goal is not to capture that which belongs to someone else he merely wants and will have what is honorably his\" the possibility that he might someday be assassinated was considered by dr king on june 5 1964 when he reported in st augustine fla that his life had been threatened he said: \"well if physical death is the price that i must pay to free my white brothers and sisters from a permanent death of the spirit then nothing can be more redemptive\"',\n",

co'' by craig zadan demanded in abusive and profane language that he get her the movie part miss russell won out tale began in 1930 the pattern for miss merman phenomenal success on broadway began with her first show a performance that became part of broadway colorful folklore in 1930 miss merman barely 21 with a few years of nightclub singing was onstage at the brooklyn paramount word drifted across the river about the big voice that was filling the brooklyn movie theater during the stage show vinton freedley who was producing the new gershwin show ''girl crazy'' went to brooklyn heard her and persuaded george gershwin to audition her the composer liked her and hired her for the show in which willie howard and ginger rogers got top billing on opening night toward the end of the first act the newcomer to broadway swung into ''i got rhythm'' rousing the savvy first-night audience with her power rhythm and poise she stopped the show as the curtain came down mr gershwin rushed backstage and pleaded with her: ''don't ever let anyone give you a singing lesson it'll ruin you'' no one ever did 'it was exciting' some years later miss merman by now an established star recalled that night saying: ''in the second chorus of 'i got rhythm' i held a high c note for 16 bars while the orchestra played the melodic line - a big tooty thing - against the note by the time i'd held that note for four bars the audience was applauding they applauded through the whole chorus and i did several encores it seemed to do something to them not because it was sweet or beautiful but because it was exciting few people have the ability to project a big note and hold it it not just a matter of breath; it a matter of power in the diaphragm i'd never trained my diaphragm but i must have a strong one when i finished that song a star had been born me'' the star whose real name was ethel agnes zimmerman was born of german and scottish parents on jan 16 1908 or 1909 or 1912 - the year changed as she grew older - in the astoria section of queens as a child she began traipsing with her father to political clubs and lodges where she sang such songs as ''k-k-k-katy'' ''maggie dooley'' and ''how you gonna keep 'em down on the farm'' even then her voice was big and her pitch true though she took a commercial course at high school and got a job as a stenographer miss merman never doubted that she would become a singer thus she left one job for another because she had heard that her boss at the second job knew important men in show business once her boss gave her a letter to a broadway producer who offered her a job in the chorus she turned it down she was determined to be a singer when she went to the palace with friends to watch the top performers in vaudeville she would often imitate the singers and sometimes say she could sing better than the high-priced talent she had seen 4 marriages 4 divorces while working as a secretary miss merman got a singing job at a small nightclub an agent lou irwin got her a six-month contract to sing for warner brothers but in fairly typical hollywood fashion the movie studio did not use her as a singer she offered to waive her salary if the studio would let her sing elsewhere during her contract the studio agreed and miss merman took nightclub jobs thus for $85 a week less than half what she could have received from warner brothers for doing nothing she was singing at a new york nightclub run by clayton jackson and durante - the last named was jimmy durante there she met a pianist named al siegel and the two got bookings at long island night spots and then she got the offer to sing at the brooklyn paramount later she was headlined at the new york paramount and the palace miss merman personal life was much rockier than her professional career her four marriages all ended in divorce the first to william b smith was brief she then married robert d levitt a hearst executive by whom she had two children ethel and robert the daughter committed suicide in 1967 her third marriage was to robert six then president of continental air lines the fourth was to ernest borgnine the actor though miss merman was successful in every kind of show business she tried she never lost her partiality for broadway ''you may have done all right elsewhere'' she said ''but you haven't really done it until you face a new york first-night crowd'' and she said just over a year ago ''broadway has been very good to me - but then i've been very good to broadway'' the medical examiner office said miss merman body would be cremated and a spokesman for the frank e campbell funeral home said that no information about the singer death or possible memorial services would be released because of the wishes of her son robert levitt\",\n",

       " 'intelligence was received last evening of the death at lexington va of gen robert e lee the most famous of the officers whose celebrity was gained in the service of the southern confederacy during the late terrible rebellion a report was received some days ago that he had been smitten with paralysis but this was denied and though it was admitted that he was seriously ill hopes of his speedy recovery seem to have been entertained by his friends within the last two or three days his symptoms had taken an unfavorable turn and he expired at 91/2 o\\'clock yesterday morning of congestion of the brain at the age of sixty-three years eight months and twenty-three days robert edmund lee was the son of gen henry lee the friend of washington and a representative of one of the wealthiest and most respected families of virginia born in january 1807 he grew up amid all the advantages which wealth and family position could give in a republican land and received the best education afforded by the institutions of his native state having inherited a taste for military studies and an ambition for military achievements he entered the national academy at west point in 1825 and graduated in 1829 the second in scholarship in his class he was at once commissioned second lieutenant of engineers and in 1835 acted as assistant astronomer in drawing the boundary line between the states of michigan and ohio in the following year he was promoted to the grade of first lieutenant and in 1836 received a captain commission one the breaking out of the war with mexico he was made chief-engineer of the army under the command of gen wool after the battle of cerro gordo in april 1847 in which he distinguished himself by his gallant conduct he was immediately promoted to the rank of major he displayed equal skill and bravery at contreras cherubusco and chapultepec and in the battle at the last-mentioned place received a severe wound his admirable conduct throughout this struggle was rewarded before its close with the commission of a lieutenant-colonel and the brevet title of colonel in 1852 he was appointed to the responsible position of superintendent of the military academy at west point which he retained until 1855 on retiring from the charge of this institution he was made lieutenant-colonel of the second calvary and on the 16th of march 1861 received the commission of colonel of the first calvary thus far the career of col lee had been one of honor and the highest promise in every service which had been entrusted to his hands he had proved efficient prompt and faithful and his merits had always been readily acknowledged and rewarded by promotion he was regarded by his superior officers as one of the most brilliant and promising men in the army of the united states his personal integrity was well known and his loyalty and patriotism was not doubted indeed it was in view of the menaces of treason and the dangers which threatened the union that he had received his last promotion but he seems to have been thoroughly imbued with that pernicious doctrine that his first and highest allegiance was due to the state of his birth when virginia joined the ill-fated movement of secession from the union he immediately threw up his commission in the federal army and offered his sword to the newly formed confederacy he took this step protesting his own attachment to the union but declaring that his sense of duty would never permit him to \"raise his hand against his relatives his children and his home\" in his farewell letter to gen scott he spoke of the struggle which this step had cost him and his wife declared that he \"wept tears of blood over this terrible war\" there are probably few who doubt the sincerity of his protestation but thousands have regretted and his best friends will ever have to regret the error of judgment the false conception of the allegiance due to his government and his country which led one so rarely gifted to cast his lot with traitors and devote his splendid talents to the execution of a wicked plot to tear asunder and ruin the republic in whose service his life had hitherto been spent he resigned his commission on the 25th of april 1861 and immediately betook himself to richmond where he was received with open arms and put in command of all the forces of virginia by gov letcher on the 10th of may he received the commission of a major-general in the army of the confederate states retaining the command in virginia and was soon after promoted to the rank of general in the regular army he first took the field in the mountainous region of western virginia where he met with many difficulties and was defeated at greenbrier by gen j j reynolds on the 3d of october 1861 he was subsequently sent to take command of the department of the south atlantic coast but after the disabling of gen joseph e johnston at the battle of fair oaks in the spring of 1862 he was recalled to virginia and placed at the head of the forces defending the capital which he led through the remainder of the campaign of the chickahominy he engaged with the army of the potomac under his old companion-in- arms gen mcclellan and drove it back to the rappahannock he afterward in august 1862 attacked the army of virginia under gen pope and after driving it back to washington crossed the potomac into maryland where he issued a proclamation calling upon the inhabitants to enlist under his triumphant banners meantime mcclellan gathered a new army from the broken remnants of his former forces and met lee at hagerstown and after a battle of two days compelled him to retreat reinforced by \"stonewall\" jackson on the 16th of september he turned to renew the battle but after two days of terrible fighting at sharpsburg and antietam was driven from the soil of maryland retiring beyond the rappahannock he took up his position at fredericksburg where he was attacked on the 13th of december by gen burnside whom he drove back with terrible slaughter he met with the same success in may 1868 when attacked by hooker at chancellorsville encouraged by these victories in the ensuing summer he determined to make a bold invasion into the territory of the north he met gen meade at gettysburg penn on the 1st of july 1863 and after one of the most terrible and destructive battles of modern times was driven from northern soil soon after this a new character appeared on the battle-fields of virginia and gen lee found it expedient to gather his forces for the defense of the confederate capital against the determined onslaughts of gen grant in the spring and summer of 1864 that indomitable soldier gradually inclosed the city of richmond as with a girdle of iron which he drew closer and closer with irresistible energy and inexorable determination repulsing the rebel forces whenever they ventured to make an attack which they did several times with considerable vigor in this difficult position holding the citadel of the confederacy and charged with its hopes and destinies lee was made commander-in-chief of the armies of the south he held out until the spring of 1865 vainly endeavoring to gather the broken forces of the confederacy and break asunder the terrible line which was closing around them after a desperate and final effort at burkesville on the 9th of april 1865 he was compelled to acknowledge his defeat and surrendered his sword to gen grant on the generous terms which were dictated by that great soldier lee retired under his parole to weldon and soon after made a formal submission to the federal government subsequently by an official clemency which is probably without a parallel in the history of the world he was formally pardoned for the active and effective part he had taken in the mad effort of the southern states to break up the union and destroy the government not long after his surrender he was invited to become the president of washington university at lexington va and was installed in that position on the 2d of october 1865 since that time he has devoted himself to the interests of that institution keeping so far as possible aloof from public notice and by his unobtrusive modesty and purity of life has won the respect even of those who most bitterly deplore and reprobate his course in the rebellion',\n",
       " \"federico fellini whose deeply personal films were vivid sometimes bizarre portraits of the human condition died yesterday at the umberto i hospital in rome he was 73 the cause was cardiac arrest the reuters news agency reported citing dr maurizio bufi the chief of the hospital intensive care unit mr fellini had suffered a stroke in august and had been in a coma since he had what has been variously described as a heart attack or heart failure on oct 17 reuters said his condition deteriorated in the last hours before his death and he developed a high fever and kidney problems four of mr fellini movies won oscars for best foreign-language film: 'la strada' in 1956 'the nights of cabiria' in 1957 '8 1/2' in 1963 and 'amarcord' in 1974 in march he received an honorary oscar in recognition of his cinematic accomplishments as a director and screenwriter before his heart trouble laid him low this year the director had reportedly been making plans to begin work on his 21st feature film next year 'block notes of a director: the actor' throughout his career mr fellini focused on his personal vision of society and his preoccupation with the relationships between men and women and between sex and love an avowed anticleric he was also deeply concerned with guilt and alienation fellini films are spiced with artifice masks masquerades and circuses startling faces the rococo and the outlandish the prisms through which he sometimes viewed life but as vincent canby the chief film critic of the new york times observed in 1985 'what important are not the prisms though they are arresting but the world he shows us: a place whose spectacularly grand studio-built artificiality makes us see the interior truth of what is taken to be the 'real' world outside which is a circus' the concepts of all fellini movies originated in the mind of 'the maestro' as his associates and compatriots fondly called him in his memories dreams fantasies and fancies he was often the protagonist of his films and his most celebrated alter ego was marcello mastroianni in 'la dolce vita' '8 1/2' and 'city of women' mr fellini wrote all his scripts usually with two dialogue writers and supervised every creative detail including the final editing he was a perfectionist who repeatedly reshot many scenes in a process that usually took two years he kept producers away from his films until they were completed explaining: 'i do not need a producer i need only a good production manager i need only a man who will give me money' devoted to movies not to commerce he studied his own movies many times but seldom saw other movies saying that most of them reflected commerce rather than art his devotion to movies over money was reflected in his uncommon willingness to surrender a large share of the potential profits from many of his films to their financial backers he likened his craft to applying a thermometer to a troubled world and finding a high fever 'i'd like very much to make a confident picture' he once told an interviewer 'i would like to be as good as nature which with a shower produces flowers and grass to cover the destruction but we are surrounded by human fragmentation by pessimism and it is difficult to talk of other things' mr fellini said he sought to liberate viewers from 'overidealized concepts of life' in a lighter vein he remarked 'i make pictures to tell a story to tell lies and to amuse' over the decades fellini films became increasingly original and subjective and consequently more controversial and less commercial his style evolved from neo-realism to fanciful neo-realism to surrealism in which he discarded narrative story lines for free-flowing freewheeling memoirs he described his approach in this way: 'when i start a picture i always have a script but i change it every day i put in what occurs to me that day out of my imagination you start on a voyage; you know where you will end up but not what will occur along the way you want to be surprised' his life centered on film making 'when i am not making movies' he confided 'i feel i am not alive' a series of scenes difficult to forget fellini movies have many unexpected and indelible sequences 'la dolce vita' opens with a huge statue of jesus with arms outstretched being towed inexplicably by a helicopter above the rooftops of rome the film '8 1/2' ends with a quixotic film director leading all his contentious associates real and imagined alive and dead in a dance of joyful reconciliation 'i vitelloni' 'the loafers' the third feature he directed is an autobiographical tragicomic tale of five provincial youths who punctuate their aimless street life with pranks 'la dolce vita' is a sensational and sobering scan of the decadent weet life' of rome cafe society with its sexual promiscuity search for exotic gratification and consuming boredom the film shocked many italians and was proscribed by the roman catholic church but it became a huge success in italy and around the world 'la strada' 'the road' is a poetic tragedy about a simple-minded waif who serves as the clown cook and concubine for a boorish brutish strongman 'the nights of cabiria' deals with a sentimental eternally hopeful prostitute who wistfully dreams of romance and respectability mr fellini most clearly autobiographical confession '8 1/2' is an innovative romantic satire-fantasy about an egomaniacal film maker moral and creative midlife crisis his malaise and inability to make a movie he titled it '8 1/2' because it was his seventh directorial feature in addition to three short films it was his favorite movie 'amarcord' 'i remember' is a paean to youth and the memories of a year in the life of a provincial italian town in the 1930 many movies even more awards in addition to oscars fellini movies won hundreds of awards including many top citations at international film festivals and five first prizes from the new york film critics his other movies also with evocative scores by nino rota include 'juliet of the spirits' 1965 his first color feature which centers on a neglected wife obsessed by dreams and spirits; 'fellini satyricon' 1969 an epic of decadence and the wanderings of a homosexual youth in ancient rome disintegrating society; 'the clowns'1970 and 'fellini roma' 1972 others were 'fellini casanova' 1976 a spectacular but joyless saga of the 18th-century philanderer conquests across europe; 'orchestra rehearsal' 1979 the most political fellini film which uses an orchestra as a metaphor for a fragmenting society and 'city of women' 1979 a feminist fantasy in which the hero searches incorrigibly for the perfect woman later films also include 'and the ship sails on' 1983 a flamboyant succession of mostly comic commentaries on art and self-absorbed artists; 'ginger and fred' 1986 whose central characters are an italian dance couple who chose their names in honor of the american dance team and who are reunited on a television variety show and 'intervista' 1987 a mock documentary described by mr canby in a review as 'a magical mixture of recollection parody memoir satire self-examination and joyous fantasy' 'tutto fellini' a retrospective of his films started on friday and is to continue through dec 21 at film forum in greenwich village scoffed at questions about meaning mr fellini was impatient with interviewers who suggested that his films had been inspired by works he had not read and who pressed him with questions about the meanings of his imagery 'meaning always meaning!' he scoffed 'when someone asks 'what do you mean in this picture' it shows he is a prisoner of intellectual sentimental shackles without his meaning he feels vulnerable' admirers said fellini films were resplendent and exhilarating and reflected a deepening and an enhancement of his art they also believed that his later movies showed maturing self-critical insights after the mid-1960 his films often stressed the bizarre the garish and the grotesque detractors praised some sequences but variously termed the works excessive simplistic and self- obsessed nonetheless the consensus was that he made brave and original movies about important issues mr canby praised mr fellini for a dazzling inventiveness and skill and an 'insatiable curiosity about and fondness for the human animal especially those who maintain only the most tenuous holds on their dignity or sanity' at his top form he omehow brings out the best in us' mr canby wrote 'we become more humane less stuffy' hailing mr fellini 'very special personal kind of cinema' the critic concluded 'one of fellini greatest gifts is his ability to communicate a sense of wonder which has the effect of making us all feel much younger than we have any right to' discovering life through films federico fellini was born on jan 20 1920 in rimini an adriatic port and resort in north-central italy his upbringing was provincial religious and middle class his father urbano was a prosperous seller of coffee and other grocery specialties whose frequent travels left his wife ida as the main parent for federico his brother riccardo and his sister maddalena the film maker fancifully recounting his youth repeatedly told interviewers that he ran away from home at the age of 7 or 8 to join a circus but later he smilingly acknowledged he had fabricated the brief episode 'to help journalists' explain his fascination for circuses the youth attended religious boarding schools where his chief talent was drawing and his chief adversaries were the rigid friars who often punished him for breaking minor rules in 1985 he told a new york audience that his love of film making originated in rimini primitive movie house which he said had 200 seats and standing room for 500 of 1930 american movies he recalled 'i discovered there existed another way of life a country of wide-open spaces of fantastic cities that were a cross between babylon and mars' he was speaking at a gala fellini tribute offered by the film society of lincoln center at the age of 17 or 18 according to his varying accounts he left home for florence where he worked for several months as a proofreader and cartoonist he went on to rome enrolling at the university of rome law school but he did not attend classes and used his student status to avoid conscription while he worked as a cartoonist and short-story writer for a satirical publication marc' aurelio he later used his cartooning talent to draw characters and scenes for his movies at 19 he joined a vaudeville troupe traveling across italy and working primarily as a gag writer while performing utility tasks the year he recalled 'was perhaps the most important year of my life' 'i was overwhelmed by the variety of the country physical landscape and too by the variety of its human landscape' he said 'it was the kind of experience that few young men are fortunate enough to have: a chance to discover the character of one country and at the same time to discover one own identity' back in rome he wrote radio scripts and started collaborating on film scripts in 1943 after a four-month courtship he married the actress giulietta masina later the star of many fellini films including 'la strada' 'the nights of cabiria' 'juliet of the spirits' and 'ginger and fred' she was a major inspiration for his life and work and is his only survivor his efforts to avoid the world war ii draft appeared doomed in 1943 when he was ordered to undergo a medical examination but according to ephraim katz 'film encyclopedia' his records were destroyed in a bombing later by hiding in rome slums he eluded german occupation troops who regularly searched the city for italian men to replenish the armed forces or to toil in slave-labor camps present at the start of a renaissance in 1944 soon after the allies liberated rome he and several friends opened the funny face shop a highly prosperous arcade that provided allied troops with caricatures portraits photos and voice recordings for their families the film director roberto rossellini visited the shop and asked him to collaborate on a documentary about the nazis' occupation of rome the venture evolved into 'open city' 1945 a benchmark neo-realistic movie that ignited italy postwar film renaissance mr fellini was the assistant director of 'open city' and a co-writer and assistant director of mr rossellini second celebrated antiwar film 'paisan' 1946 and his controversial religious film 'the miracle' 1948 in which mr fellini was co-star with

first solo directorial effort was the 1951 'white sheik' released here in 1956 a broad lampoon of italy adult comic-strip industry both movies were critical and commercial failures but they were later re-released and praised determined to direct films mr fellini struggled financially to complete his next project 'i vitelloni' which became a major success in italy and abroad he consolidated his international prestige with 'la strada' the film maker was an exuberant articulate bearlike man with an expressive face a whimsical charm and a spontaneous demonstrative manner he often gestured with both hands even while driving one of his favorite motor cars tolerant overseer of sets of babel on movie sets he savored his power as the ringmaster of a felliniesque world jauntily wearing a wide-brimmed usually black hat he dominated the scene alternately improvising quipping and clowning some directors insist on silence on the set but he preferred a touch of chaos he liked to shoot scenes sequentially but he usually did not care in what language performers spoke because he dubbed most dialogue often using other actors to do so because he believed the voices of most people did not match their looks over the years he directed thousands of nonprofessional actors he was very demanding of performers usually cajoling them to get what he wanted and he coaxed many professionals to give the best performances of their careers for decades the fellinis had a small apartment in rome for convenience but their principal home was a modest seaside house he built in 1965 in the suburb of fregene he read widely in his youth but later concentrated on newspaper articles which provided grist for his imagination asked once by a friend when he planned to take a vacation he replied quickly: 'making a movie is my vacation all the rest the traveling about to premieres the interviews the social life the endless arguments with producers who don't understand me that is the work' he is survived by his wife a poet who sang a song of himself federico fellini was a poet of the cinema whose work illuminated by unforgettable images was intensely autobiographical these are some of his films and when they were made followed by the dates of release in the united states\",\n",

to make beautiful women more elegant\" \\'tyrant of hemlines\\' crowned by tacit consent as monarch of the haute couture but sometimes also as the \"tyrant of the hemlines\" m dior once credited the fame of his creations to this credo: please the ladies by enabling them to please their men \"cri-cri\" as he was called by his intimates was by his scope as well as by his styles designer number one in the world of high fashion he branched out faster and farther than any other couturier ever had the dior interests at his death included not only the original maison dior on the avenue montaigne in paris--a business structure of mirrored and chandeliered elegance--but also dior enterprises in twenty-four countries reporting grossing $15000000 a year his creation of the long hemline and full skirt in 1947 set off an international controversy but clearly re-established paris on its fashion throne but behind the vast dior enterprises was always the plump pink-cheeked master who twice each year went into seclusion to create the newest designs and much of that time each year he spent in the bathtub usually his empire tub of green marble lined with silvery metal and fitted with swan-head faucets there he soaked and pondered a new line and sketched his ideas on scraps of paper m dior \"new look\" came out about a year after he had established his own salon but he created almost as much of a sensation three years ago with his \"h-line\" often called the \"flat look\" other dior innovations included the zigzag generous decollete the vertical high value on the bosom leaving to the legs their length and elegance the oval underlining the roundness of the hips the profile \"precision\" in molding the contours and the tulip high bosom \\'luxury must be defended\\' m dior saw more than mere cloth-cutting in his world of fashion \"in a machine age\" he once declared \"dressmaking is one of the last refuges of the human the personal the inimitable in an epoch as somber as ours luxury must be defended inch by inch\" he had no intention as a young man to become a dressmaker the son of a wealthy chemical fertilizer manufacturer young dior--born at granville france on jan 21 1905--was expected to go into diplomacy he prepared for college at janson de sailly the fashionable paris preparatory school and then was sent to the school of political science of the university of paris but at the age of 23 influenced by friendships he had formed with a number of artists he turned his back on diplomacy to become an art dealer his art gallery was said to have been among the first to exhibit surrealist paintings displaying pictures by such friends of his as salvador dali christian berard and jean cocteau in 1934 mr dior became ill and was forced to give up the little art gallery he spent a year convalescing then returned to paris during the world-wide crisis of the nineteen thirties the dior family had lost much of their fortune and young dior had to do something more than sell pictures to exist the figaro illustrated engaged him as an illustrator for a weekly page devoted to haute couture his designs for hats quickly captured feminine fancies in paris and agnes the famous place vendome milliner ordered entire collections from him he went briefly into dress designing for piguet but then the war broke out and he was mustered into the french army as a private first class in the engineers in 1941 he became a designer again this time for lucien lelong in 1946 when the french ministry of production lifted cloth rationing m dior with the backing of marcel boussac french cotton millionaire set up his own salon it was almost big business from the start operated on terms of big business unknown to other firms in the fashion world the dior organization includes general statistical surveys the control of revenue and costs through the use of business machines and a program against copying that permitted the immediate identification of dresses sold in france and overseas m dior who remained a bachelor once was described as \"diffident unassuming balding\" he was a hard worker often insisted that his lunch--usually a salad boiled ham and fruit--be taken to him in his studio where the lights often stayed ablaze long into the night a dior presentation was one of the high points of the fashion world but m dior once described the opening of his shows this way: \"the dressing room is a picture of hell whereas to the public it has to appear as a bouquet\"',\n",
       " 'fred m vinson enjoyed a noteworthy career in each of the three branches of the federal government--legislative executive and judicial in twelve years in the house of representatives he won wide renown as a tax and fiscal expert then in world war ii he served in top administrative posts as economic stabilizer federal loan administrator assistant president and secretary of the treasury finally in 1946 he was appointed by president truman as chief justice of the united states in all three fields he distinguished himself by the exercise of his most characteristic quality his exceptional ability as a negotiator a trouble-shooter a reconciler of conflicting views a man who could reduce warring factions to at least outward harmony and so get things done probably his finest achievement was the application of this soothing technique to the bitter personal feuds and doctrinal disputes that had rent the supreme court for a long time before his appointment within a year after he became chief justice members of the august tribunal who previously had refused to speak were bowing to each other from the waist what was more important the court had regained the public confidence and respect which it had lost because of the dissension in its midst but it was this highly commended trait that caused trouble for the chief justice and his good friend president truman in 1948 then the president without pondering all the implications and potential repercussions decided it would be a fine idea to send his great negotiator to moscow to negotiate personally with premier stalin for the lifting of the soviet blockade of berlin and peaceful relations generally but general of the army george c marshall then secretary of state had previously taken the lead in breaking off direct negotiations with the russians and in referring the berlin matter to the security council amid a flood of protest from all sides that the president proposal was embarrassing our allies breaking the united front of the western nations and providing the communists with a new weapon for their \"peace\" propaganda secretary marshall rushed back from a paris meeting of the security council and succeeded in talking the president out of the idea mr truman said later he had not intended any appeasement but merely to try to convince marshal stalin of our sincerity friendship with truman the chief justice friendship with the president was one of the most important facts of both their lives this friendship began when both were in congress mr truman in the senate and mr vinson in the house it developed into an especially close relationship after the death of the late president franklin d roosevelt in 1945 when the president went to key west in the winter the chief justice would accompany him or visit him the vinson family would go to the white house for thanksgiving dinner with the trumans both the president and the chief justice had telephones by their beds and regularly held long talks at night in which the president received mr vinson advice and counsel on many problems throughout the truman administration mr vinson was regarded as one of the real inner circle at the white house one of the \"top ten\" mr vinson name was frequently mentioned as a possible democratic candidate for president in 1948 and 1952 if mr truman did not choose to run the chief justice was generally regarded in washington as the president choice to succeed him in 1952 if mr truman himself did not run but mr vinson let it be known he had no presidential ambitions and early in 1952 it was reported he had indicated to the president he preferred not to be a candidate at one time when secretary of state dean acheson was under fire and reports of his resignation were current mr vinson was mentioned in washington as his possible successor mr vinson regarded himself as \"a little left of center\" in politics he was considered a moderate new dealer and supported most of president roosevelt policies but maintained a stubborn independence and opposed any projects which he thought passed beyond the line of true liberalism into \"totalitarian\" liberalism political washington marked him down as both \"anti-socialist and anti-reactionary\" in the supreme court he became one of the middle-of-the-road \"liberal-conservative\" group that sought to reconcile national security with individual rights and maintain a balance to preserve and strengthen both amid the problems of the \"cold war\" era had pleasing personality physically mr vinson was a tall large vigorous man with gray hair blue eyes deep lines in his face dark circles under his eyes and shaggy eyebrows a friend of his once said: \"he looks like an extremely dignified sheep with a hangover but he is not at all like a sheep and he never has a hangover\" he was genial affable and kindly hearty and sincere amiable and unaffected a convivial companion who occasionally took a drink but not often a dignified man of grave demeanor calm judgment a great amount of patience and an easy manner it was this pleasing personality combined with a mellow sense of humor a folksy way of talking a homespun philosophy and a common-sense approach to hard problems together with a hardworking ambitious nature a canny and logical mind and great political know-how that won him such wide friendships in all branches of governmental washington his selection as chief justice after the death of harian fiske stone was largely due to his demonstrated capacity as a mediator in troubled situations at the time the supreme court was split into two warring groups and beset with personal as well as legal animosities one was headed by associate justice hugo black a former senator from alabama the other by associate justice robert g jackson of new york a former attorney general of the united states both were appointees of president roosevelt the feuding between the two groups which had been going on in private before justice stone death with occasional hints finding their way into print flared into the open immediately after justice vinson appointment president truman and others in high places in washington had been familiar with the situation before and there is reason to believe that mr vinson was named to the court primarily to bring peace and restore some of the court prestige with the bar and public mr vinson had manifested his talent on a national basis for the first time while serving as chairman of a subcommittee of the house ways and means committee considering new sources of governmental revenue tax proposals submitted by the treasury department stirred a small-scale revolt in congress and inspired vigorous opposition from business by virtue of skillful negotiation and a constant search for common ground mr vinson was able to whip into shape a bill that was satisfactory to president roosevelt and at the same time able to command the support of majorities in both houses of congress chosen to fight inflation he gave a further demonstration after president roosevelt induced him to leave the court of appeals bench to which he had been appointed as a reward for congressional services to become direct or in 1943 of the office of economic stabilization one of the main tasks of the agency was to prevent the nation from starting on an inflationary spiral that would impair its ability to wage the two-front global war in which it was then engaged stability was being threatened by union demands for wage increases on the one hand and industry demands for price increases on the other james f byrnes a former senator and associate justice of the supreme court had held the post before mr vinson the two had much in common and were to follow each other in several other war-agency posts before they became members of president truman cabinet mr byrnes as secretary of state and mr vinson as secretary of the treasury as economic stabilizer mr vinson was a controversial figure he came under attack by the heads of the oil industry when he refused to sanction a price increase of 35 cents a barrel and under even heavier fire from the railway brotherhoods when he rejected wage increases that another governmental agency had recommended philip murray president of the congress of industrial organizations and william green president of the american federation of labor who differed on other things joined in brining unsuccessful pressure to bear on mr vinson for wage increases however his adamant stand affected his relationship with labor and industry leaders it endeared him to congress and his appointment as administrator of the federal loan agency was hailed by democrats and republicans alike the vacancy had been caused by president roosevelt ouster of jesse jones as secretary of commerce and federal loan administrator to make a place in the cabinet for henry a wallace whom the democrats had refused to renominate for vice president distrustful of mr wallace radicalism the congress had separated the functions of secretary of commerce and loan administrator before the senate confirmed the wallace appointment mr vinson tenure as loan administrator was very brief he had no more than restored morale and got the agency working smoothly again after the repercussions of the jones- wallace contest than he was drafted to replace mr byrnes as director of war mobilization and reconversion where his main task was to chart a course that would enable the country to make the transition from war to peace without undue disruption of the economic system his major contribution as director of war mobilization and reconversion was the issuance of several reports pointing out the road the country must follow which won widespread acclaim the purposes of the reports were to dissipate uncertainties about government policies in the transition period and enable business and labor to plan intelligently their future relations it was the general view at the time that he succeeded magnificently in the assignment victory in europe came while he was in this office but he was not allowed to remain to put the program he had developed into practice instead president truman who had succeeded to the white house on president roosevelt death called upon him to head the treasury department henry morgenthau jr never had enjoyed cordial relations with congress and with tax legislation again a subject of major discussion the new president decided the treasury department needed as its head a man in the good graces of congress and conversant with tax sentiment and problems he remained as head of the treasury until called upon by president truman to become chief justice and act as peacemaker in the court feud as secretary he brought about the first reduction in tax rates in fourteen years recommending a bill which congress accepted removing almost 12000000 persons from the tax rolls through increased exemptions one of mr vinson first opinions as chief justice early in 1947 accompanied the supreme court decision upholding the conviction of john l lewis and the united mine workers for contempt of court in the 1946 coal strike later that year after the new chief justice had demonstrated his success in bringing at least outward peace to the court he received from president truman the medal of merit for \"exceptionally meritorious performance of outstanding service to the united states\" in world war ii in 1948 mr vinson wrote the unanimous opinion that declared that convenants to bar negroes and other racial groups from owning real estate were legally unenforceable administered oath to truman chief justice vinson administered the oath of office to president truman on jan 20 1949 when the later was inaugurated as the thirty-second president of the united states mr vinson declared in a speech that summer taking note of foreign developments that the united states \"must keep our powder dry\" later in the year he told the american bar association that the large number of dissents in the supreme court were to be welcomed not deplored they conclusively proved that the united states was a democracy he explained adding that regular unanimity among judges is possible only in fascist and communist systems in 1950 justice vinson wrote two opinions in which the court held that segregation of negroes in the universities of texas and oklahoma violated the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution he also took part in a majority decision that segregation on railroad dining cars violated the interstate commerce act justice vinson wrote the majority opinion in 1950 that upheld the constitutionality of the non-communist oath required of union officials by the taft-hartley labor-management relations act in 1951 he wrote the majority opinion that validated the constitutionality of the smith act under which the eleven top leaders of the communist party of the united states had been convicted in new york of criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate overthrow of the government by force and violence opinion on communist bail later the same year a vinson majority opinion held that $50000 bail each for twelve communists arrested in california for smith act violations had not been fixed by proper methods and directed the return of the case to the lower court for a hearing on the reduction of bail he wrote that the united states in fighting communism must not accept communist methods and added that communists like everyone else were entitled to reasonable bail unless the government could prove evidence justifying exceptional bail early in 1952 justice vinson took part in a majority opinion that upheld the constitutionality of the feinberg law prohibiting the employment of school teachers in new york who advocate overthrow of the government by force and violence or belong to subversive organizations later he joined with the majority in opinions upholding the conviction of six members of counsel for contempt of court in the trial of the eleven communist leaders in new york and in upholding the constitutionality of laws making

as a boy he had been a better than average baseball player but in his later years he eschewed all forms of athletics nor did he care for the elaborate social functions that are so much a part of official life in washington and rarely attended them his favorite relaxations were reading exchanging gossip with his neighbors and playing bridge or poker with a few close cronies like many another

interruption the congressional service of mr vinson that began in 1924 was continuous until his appointment by president roosevelt as an associated justice of the court of appeals for the district of columbia in 1938 the break came in 1928 when he refused to heed the advice of political advisers that he dissociate his own campaign for re-election from the democratic presidential campaign of alfred e smith instead he devoted most of his campaign speeches to attacks on bigotry in 1930 he was re-elected as a member of congress he was generally regarded as conservative in the southern tradition but

what did \"happen\" was generally not talked about it was from this background that mrs wharton was to inherit the belief from which she never departed that \"any one gifted with the least creative faculty knows the absurdity of such a charge\" as that of \"putting flesh-and-blood people into books\" later critics were to say that in this was her greatest lack the young author wrote her first efforts on brown paper salvaged from parcels she was not encouraged \"in the eyes of our provincial society\" she was later to say \"authorship was still regarded as something between a black art and a form of manual labor\" each was equally despised in her social level her first acceptance was three poems which she sent to the editor with her calling card attached wrote a novel at 11 in her autobiography mrs wharton gives a picture of her literary beginnings along with a picture of her life her first novel written when she as 11 began: \"\\'oh how do you do mrs brown\\' said mrs tompkins \\'if only i had known you were going to call i should have tidied up the drawing room\\'\" the little girl showed it to her mother whose icy comment was: \"drawing rooms are always tidy\" her first published book was a collaboration called \"the decoration of homes\" how many short stories she wrote before 1899 is not know but she was encouraged in her writing by such friends as egerton winthrop and walter berry and somehow while abroad met paul bourget the \"chronicler of the bourgeoisie\" other mentors were william brownell and edward burlingame for many years editor of scribner magazine in her autobiography she writes: \"i do not think i have ever forgotten one word of the counsels they gave me\" to which a well- known critic added \"one well believes it\" but it was henry james who was her closest friend and most worth-while advocate she was always his respectful disciple and although in their many meetings he disguised the severity of his judgments with his usual elaborate verbal courtesies he managed to convey the meaning of his criticism he remained her close friend until his death in 1899 mrs wharton--she had been married to edward wharton a boston banker in 1885-- published her first book: \"the greater inclination\" in this may be found two of her best short stories  \"the pelican\" and \"souls belated\" this volume did not make her a wide reputation overnight in fact it was not until 1905 that she gained a large public although in the interim there had appeared these books: \"the touchstone\" \"crucial instances\" \"the valley of decision\" and \"the descent of man and other stories\" and her flare for travel books had asserted itself in two volumes on italy its villas and gardens in 1905 she published her first of many best-sellers \"the house of mirth\" most critics do not consider this her greatest book but its popularity established her as a writer this was in reality her first novel although she had written long short stories in her other books its title came from the biblical assertion \"the heart of fools is in the house of mirth\" and it was a happy title for projecting as wilbur cross once put it \"a group of pleasure-loving new yorkers mostly as dull as they are immoral and letting them play out their drama unmolested by others\" other novels came in rapid succession but none attracted the attention in this country that was reserved for the book elmer davis once called \"the last great american love story\"--\"ethan frome\" those which had gone between were \"madame de treymes\" in which certain french critics detected the influence of flaubert and maupassant; \"the fruit of the tree\" \"the hermit and the wild woman\" and \"artemis to actaeon\" \"ethan frome\" which was most successfully dramatized two seasons ago was written in 1911 in it she most successfully blended the psychological refinements she had learned from henry james with her own inimitable ability to tell a story with a beginning and an end one critic has said it is comparable only to the work of nathaniel hawthorne as a tragedy of new england life a novelette it is considered a masterpiece of love and frustration and is likely to stand despite its comparative brevity as her most accomplished work until 1906 mrs wharton had divided her time between new york and her summer home at lenox mass in that year she went to live in france in summer at saint brice and in winter at hyeres in provence did relief work in war when the world war broke out she was in paris and she plunged at once into relief work opening a room for skilled women of the quarter where she lived who were thrown out of employment by the closing of workrooms she also fed and housed 600 belgian refugee orphans in recognition france awarded her the cross of the legion of honor and belgium made her a chevalier of the order of leopold meanwhile she wrote stories and articles on the war including \"fighting france\" and \"the marne\" after the war she visited africa with general lyautey at the invitation of the french government and wrote as a result \"in morocco\" \"the age of innocence\" was her next book and in terms of sales her most successful here she used actually the materials she had hitherto used only for background--the social life of the new york into which she had been born and in which she was bread published serially here and abroad it was widely read and was awarded the pulitzer prize for 1920 it showed mrs wharton at her best understanding the cramped society of her youth unaware of the world beyond it four years later she followed it with four novelettes published under the title of \"old new york\" a constricted panorama of society in the forties fifties sixties and seventies respectively shortly after the publication of this volume she was made an officer of the legion of honor then she returned to america to be awarded the gold medal of the national institute of arts and letters the first woman to be so honored in 1924 she also became the first woman to be awarded an honorary doctor of letters degree by yale university in 1930 she was made a member of the national institute of arts and letters four years later she was elected to membership in the american academy of arts and letters since that time she had written other books including \"twilight sleep\" a story of fashionable life in modern new york; \"the children\" a study of the children of expatriated divorcees; \"hudson river bracketed\" a study of a modern writer and \"certain people\" a collection of short stories but that was many years ago that generation which knew her best for \"the age of innocence\" flocked to see \"ethan frome\" when it was adapted for the stage by owen davis and his son donald presented on broadway with pauline lord ruth gordon and raymond massey in the leading roles the grim tragedy proved to be as good theatre as it had previously been a great book \"ethan frome\" was not the only one of her books to have been translated into plays in recent years \"the age of innocence\" helped add to the luster of katharine cornell eight years ago and one of her shorter pieces became \"the old maid\" of the theatre in which judith anderson and helen menken starred in 1935',\n",

       " 'general of the army douglas macarthur served his country as a soldier for more than 60 years he achieved the highest acclaim for his exploits as a grand strategist in world war ii and in korea and then held the center stage in one of the bitterest civil versus military controversies in the history of the nation virtually every military honor was bestowed upon him yet his active career ended in bitterness and recrimination when he was relieved of his command in the midst of a war by his commander in chief his life was marked by no struggle against poverty or lack of privilege his rise to prominence was unmarred by temporary setbacks or misfortune even the final discordant note of his career--his removal from command--left him serenely confident in his judgment outwardly unmoved by the events that swirled about him believed in destiny general macarthur evaluation of his role in history was probably most succinctly and characteristically voiced by him in 1950 in a protracted conversation with a newspaper correspondent who had known him for many years asked if he could explain his success he puffed slowly at his corncob pipe looked out the window of his tokyo office across a moat at the imperial palace ground and said: \"i believe it was destiny\" douglas macarthur was born jan 26 1880 in a sestion of the armory building at fort dodge little rock ark that had been set aside as the post hospital he was the third of three sons born to capt arthur macarthur and his virginia-born wife the former mary pinkney hardy his eldest brother was arthur born in 1876 who graduated from the united states naval academy in 1896 had a distinguished naval career in the spanish-american war the boxer rebellion in china and as commander of the light cruiser uss chattanooga in world war i arthur died of a ruptured appendix in 1923 the second brother was malcolm born 1878 who died at the age of 5 of the older brother death general macarthur wrote 40 years later \"his premature death left a gap in my life which has never been filled\" general macarthur father was the son of arthur macarthur a descendant of the macartair branch of the clan campbell the macartairs had their seat near glasgow scotland general macarthur grandfather with his widowed mother came to this country in 1825 and settled in chicopee falls mass he became a lawyer recollections of grandfather general macarthur recollections of his grandfather remained he said vivid in his memory in his memoirs to be published next fall by mcgraw-hill he told the story of a court case presided over by his grandfather one of the contending lawyers appeared to have overstated his case and lost the suit he recounted the episode to his grandson douglas \"my grandfather\" he wrote \"thus illustrated a lesson which unhappily i have not always kept in mind: never talk more than is necessary\" general macarthur father was destined for west point but in august 1862 a little more than a year after the outbreak of the civil war he joined the 24th wisconsin volunteer infantry he rose through the ranks won the medal of honor in the battle of missionary ridge in november 1863 and was known as \"the boy colonel\" the war over he left the army to study law was recalled to the ranks and fought against the indians in the west while he was on duty at fort dodge his third son was born in 1898 the elder macarthur was ordered to the philippines where following the capitulation of spain he fought against emilio aguinaldo revolutionaries including manuel quezon the elder macarthur rose to major general commanding the army of the philippines and retired as a lieutenant general during these years douglas macarthur and his mother remained in the united states while he prepared for entry into west point the macarthurs had established their home in milwaukee it was there in 1898 that he took the competitive examinations for the united states military academy \"always before me\" he wrote many years after \"was the vision of west point that greatest military institution in the world to join the long gray line had been the lodestar of all my hopes since the sound of bugles had ushered me into the world\" he passed the examination with high marks and entered west point in june 1899 much has been written of his west point military and academic record in the four undergraduate years he attained a scholastic record not equaled in the previous 25 years he recalled that there were others in his class smarter than he but said that his achievement resulted perhaps from having \"a somewhat clearer perspective of events--a better realization that first things come first or perhaps it was just luck\" if his military scholastic and athletic records were outstanding as a cadet his tutelage was among the strangest ever noted on the plains of west point mother lived near academy his mother established a residence just off the west point reservation her son visited her every day of his cadet life recalling a crisis in his cadet career when he was summoned to a hearing on the question of hazing at the academy and faced the challenge of being ordered to disclose the names of culprits involved general macarthur told of his mother stanch support of his decision to remain silent on pain of dismissal he wrote that his mother \"sensed the struggle raging in my soul\" and composed an inspirational poem urging him to stand fast \"i knew then what to do\" he wrote he remained in the academy and graduated first in his class with many honors in 1903 he chose the corps of engineers he recalled because chances of promotion were good in that branch much of general macarthur success as a cadet has been credited by him and associates of the period to his mother the indomitable \"pinky\" macarthur with his father serving in the army 10000 miles away in that critical period of his life the young cadet drew from the aristocratic forceful woman the inspiration and strength that sometimes come from both parents to her throughout his life general macarthur attributed his sense of rectitude and \"destiny\" that was to move his admirers to boundless praise and annoy those who thought him an egocentric as a newly commissioned second lieutenant he was posted to the philippines and was involved in surveying the islands where although the insurrection had been put down skirmishes with moro dissidents were not uncommon and survey parties were ambushed from time to time there for the first time he heard shots fired in anger and as a prelude to many escapes in many other battlefields he once had his hat shot off in the years before world war i general macarthur saw service in mexico once disguising himself as a drifter to lead a raiding party an early evidence of his proclivity for independent action as a captain he served in the expeditionary forces at veracruz the ascendance of his military star began with the outbreak of world war i he helped to organize the 42d rainbow division and went to france as commander of one of its brigades exhibiting daring and dash--frequently to the annoyance of his superiors--he savored the excitement of war and the dangers of combat moreover he displayed the detached self- confidence that marked his career through nearly a half-century as an active soldier competition for sedan as a brigade commander with the temporary rank of brigadier general he directed actions that sometimes ran counter to grand strategy on one occasion with the capture of the french city of sedan assigned to the french army he entered into competition with the french to be first in the town the prize was of particular significance to the french because it was the site of the surrender of the french to the germans in 1870 orders for the operation had been drawn up by col george c marshall an operations officer at the headquarters of the american expeditionary force general macarthur acted on his own interpretation of the orders history recorded conflicting accounts of which forces first entered sedan but the french were listed officially as the first thirty-three years later george c marshall then secretary of defense drew up another set of orders to which there was no opportunity for general macarthur to apply a dissenting interpretation they were the orders in 1951 relieving general macarthur of his far east commands during the korean conflict having once said to general macarthur \"young man i do not like your attitude\" gen john j pershing commanding the american expeditionary force in france nevertheless pinned the distinguished service cross and the distinguished service medal on the bold young officer in 1919 general macarthur returned to the united states and was appointed superintendent of the united states military academy he was credited with broadening the curriculum and raising the status of the army \"trade school\" to academic levels equal to those of nonmilitary colleges and universities encouraged athletics a former varsity football and baseball player general macarthur encouraged intramural athletics and wrote the motto that now stands in bronze on the inner wall of west point new gymnasium: \"upon the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that upon other fields on other days will bear the fruits of victory\" sinking into peacetime doldrums and sagging appropriations from congress and public unconcern with military might in a world that had just won democracy \"ultimate\" triumph over tyranny the army offered only routine duties at routine stations for its professionals general macarthur filled a number of these assignments at home and in the philippines he became involved routinely in a lively controversy as a member of the court in the court-martial of brig gen william b mitchell in 1926 billy mitchell was an enthusiastic champion of the airplane as an instrument of war after having publicly charged the government with having failed to recognize the validity of this position he was court-martialed the court ruled the charges against him \"proved\" and he resigned from the army for decades rumors neither confirmed nor denied by general macarthur said that general macarthur had cast a dissenting vote the actual vote was never disclosed general macarthur achieved his fourth star in 1930 when he was named chief of staff of the army by president herbert hoover it was in this post during the depression that he came into sharp contact with the realities of the disarray in the nation economic life in the summer of 1932 several thousand unemployed men many of them veterans of world war i gathered in washington to demand immediate payment of war bonuses they camped in squalor on washington anacostia flats amid widespread sympathy for their plight but to the vast embarrassment of the hoover administration eisenhower an aide on july 29 president hoover issued written orders to chief of staff macarthur to clear and destroy the camp the task was accomplished with maj dwight d eisenhower an assistant executive officer to the assistant secretary of war at his side general macarthur directed the operation of the scene in some newspapers general macarthur was pictured as a beribboned military dandy directing his troops to shoot down hungry former soldiers when president franklin d roosevelt succeeded mr hoover general macarthur was re- appointed chief of staff of the army he held the post until 1935 longer than any predecessor there have been charges by general macarthur critics that with the war in europe only four years away he was no more aware despite his position as chief of staff of the strides germany and japan were making toward waging a modern war than other top officers in the united states military establishment he was credited however in the face of penurious appropriations with having effected a minor modernization of the army in his friendly biography of general macarthur \"the untold story of douglas macarthur\" frazier hunt discussed at length the general dispute with president roosevelt over the president attempt to reduce military appropriations mr hunt wrote that general macarthur had threatened to resign and take his case to the people unless the president dropped plans for certain drastic reductions in military budgets it was not the first nor was it to be the last time general macarthur showed himself to be recalcitrant to higher authority it was noted by observers of the proud and stiff professional soldier as another of those curious stances he took that appeared to belie the very essence of his training and profession--discipline and compliance with orders from above the man who demanded and got complete obedience to his orders on the part of subordinates did not always apply the military golden rule to himself in such moments he explained himself as being \"animated by the sole desire to help restore preserve and advance those great american principles and ideals of which we have been beneficiaries ourselves and are not trustees for future generations\" used words as weapons throughout his career he used words as weapons often soaring to heights of grandiloquence in search of a phrase inspirational in content sonorous in tone and evocative of his call to \"destiny\" no rapport ever developed between president roosevelt and general macarthur each had his \"style\" as in his relations with all commanders in chief during his active military service general macarthur appeared unable to acknowledge that a civilian whose trade was politics could be the repository of ultimate wisdom among his statements and writings references to a president as the \"commander in chief\" are sparse president roosevelt relieved general macarthur as chief of staff on oct 3 1935 and named gen malin craig as his successor resuming his permanent rank of major general general macarthur was sent to the philippines as military adviser to the commonwealth for two years he worked at building a military force in the philippines that might ultimately be capable of defending the islands with american help on aug 6 1937 he was notified that he would be returned shortly for duty in the united states stating that his task in the philippines was not yet completed he abruptly terminated 34 years of uninterrupted service by applying for retirement from the army in a message addressing him as \"dear douglas\" president roosevelt notified him that his retirement had been granted the president wrote: \"your record in war as in peace is a brilliant chapter of american history\" manuel quezon the philippines commonwealth president then appointed him field marshal of the philippines he was the only american to hold such a rank it was then exercising the privileges of that exalted rank that general macarthur designed the gold leaf-encrusted garrison cap that along with sunglasses and a corncob pipe was to become his trademark the philippines government paid the commander a salary of $25000 a year and provided him with a penthouse atop the manila hotel other emoluments were provided making it possible for him to live as he did later in tokyo and in the waldorf towers a simple life amid luxurious surroundings it was noted during his service to the philippines government that general macarthur was the highest paid military officer in recent history his considerable investments both in the philippines and in this country were the basis of frequent conjecture but their extent and nature were never disclosed his mode of living after achieving top rank was such that he seldom opened a door drove an automobile or had to perform the myriad personal tasks of ordinary persons spare and just short of 6 feet tall general macarthur maintained a deceptively jaunty air that the unsuspecting thought invited familiarity which was swiftly and coolly spurned save for his battered braid-encrusted campaign cap his military dress was simplicity itself almost ostentatiously he wore no ribbons insignia or braid other than the tiny circlet of five stars on his right collar tabs as the possibility of war grew the philippine army was merged with the united states army under the command of general macarthur who was restored to duty with the american forces as a lieutenant general on july 27 1941 in december he was made a full general 11 days after the japanese attack on pearl harbor that attack was followed on the same day by a japanese attack on military installations in the philippines where general macarthur forces were caught completely by surprise his air arm was virtually destroyed his air command later explained that it was caught at clark field simple because there were no other airfields capable of receiving it now began the greatest fighting retreat of general macarthur life a hardened well-equipped japanese force landed on luzon and struck toward the fortified united states military base on bataan peninsula into which macarthur had drawn his forces with the opening of the battle on dec 10 general macarthur commanded 12000 philippine scouts and 19000 united states troops added to this force were about 100000 partly equipped filipinos the japanese rolled the american forces into the bataan peninsula where it was hoped they could hold our for 14 months roosevelt reported incensed general macarthur assured his troops that this aid would be forthcoming although he had been given no assurances by washington that reinforcements would come his assurances to his troops reached president roosevelt and it was reported the president was incensed by general macarthur statements an entry into the diary of william hassett a white house aide published in 1953 disclosed that the president had said it had been \"criminal for general macarthur to raise false hopes among his men\" meanwhile the highly trained japanese forces tightened the noose around bataan forcing the american and filipino troops toward the tip of the peninsula setting the stage for the final battle for corregidor as general macarthur directed the defense from the labyrinthine underground fortifications of corregidor orders came to him on feb 22 to leave his command in the hands of lieut gen jonathan skinny wainwright and proceed to australia to take command of the newly created southwest pacific area bidding farewell to his men and their filipino comrades general macarthur uttered a phrase that was to be added to his trademarks \"i shall return\" he said with his wife and their 4-year-old-son arthur and a chinese amah or nursemaid general macarthur was taken off corregidor by a pt boat in a dramatic dash learned of allies\\' plight arriving in melbourne the general learned in full detail the plight of the retreating allies from the philippines to southeast asia he began agitating washington with demands for more men and equipment seeming not to comprehend or not to want to understand that the war in europe held first priority for the time being in addition he expressed bitter disappointment that the area of his command had been limited he dreamed of relieving corregidor up to the very moment of its capitulation to the japanese on may 5 1942 until this time united states strategy in the pacific was wholly defensive but with the increase in allied strength the initiative passed from the japanese and on aug 7 1942 marines landed at guadalcanal a prolonged struggle took place and it was not until early in february 1943 that the japanese were forced to evacuate guadalcanal it was general macarthur belief and that of the navy that the bismarcks barrier had to be broken the macarthur-navy agreement on this point however did not extend to the over-all strategy of defeating japan in fact the views of the general and those of admiral chester w nimitz united states commander in the pacific were to be opposed until the middle of 1944 general macarthur favored moving up on japan through the solomons and bismarcks by what he called the new guinea-mindanao axis he wanted to have the entire fleet and amphibious forces under his command to liberate the philippines before advancing on japan itself the navy plan which the general opposed as too long a route was for an advance through the pacific taking key points in the gilbert marshall and caroline islands on the way then to the marianas to taiwan and finally to the coast of china to establish a base for the assault on japan the plan that was adopted in may 1943 was a combination of the two but pointing toward china as the invasion base for japan a move later abandoned in deference to general macarthur in june general macarthur forces supported by the navy began the slow grinding process of leapfrogging their way through the japanese-held islands by the end of february 1944 the gilbert and marshall islands had been secured and the bismarcks barrier had been broken from then on general macarthur forces advanced steadily taking the admiralties at the same time as admiral nimitz forces drove into the marianas tinian and guam philippines in question during the months that followed it was left open whether the general would try to liberate all or part of the philippines or go straight from mindanao and the marianas into taiwan the navy wanted to go directly into taiwan from saipan and mindanao bypassing the other philippine islands general macarthur was still intent on liberating all of the philippines and using luzon as the springboard to japan he made a strong emotional appeal backed up by strategic arguments that the united states was honor-bound to liberate the philippines at a conference in pearl harbor in july 1944 he convinced both president roosevelt and admiral nimitz to liberate the philippines first on oct 30 1944 two and a half years after he had vowed to return to the philippines general macarthur waded ashore at leyte and proclaimed: \"i have returned by the grace of almighty god our forces stand again on philippine soil\" on dec 18 1944 he was promoted to the newly created rank of general of the army his forces went on to manila which fell feb 25 1945 by this time okinawa had been chosen as a substitute for taiwan or china as the last stop before japan okinawa fell in july the next month the doom of japan was sealed with the dropping of the first atomic bombs used in warfare on nagasaki and hiroshima the long-expected bloody assault on the japanese home islands was a nightmare that never happened the destroyed empire was reduced to a shattered charred and bewildered collection of islands that had never known a conqueror boot unconditional surrender in a career studded with military triumphs the greatest of these for general macarthur came on sept 2 1945 when japanese representatives boarded the battleship uss missouri in tokyo bay to sign the unconditional surrender documents under his gaze representing emperor hirohito mamoru shigemitsu attired in morning coat and top hat clumped to the document table on his one sound and one artificial leg it appeared that the japanese representative intended to read the surrender document before signing it \"show him where to sign sutherland\" the general ordered lieut gen richard k sutherland his chief of staff without further hesitation the foreign minister signed his name the japanese empire was ended a few years later general macarthur assayed his role as supreme commander of the occupation of japan as follows: \"if the historian of the future should deem my service worthy of some slight reference it would be my hope that he mention me not as a commander engaged in campaigns and battles even though victorious to american arms but rather as that one whose sacred duty it became once the guns were silenced to carry to the land of our vanquished foe the solace and hope and faith of christian morals \"could i have but a line a century hence crediting a contribution to the advance of peace i would yield every honor which has been accorded by war\" the occupation of a proud nation prostrate bewildered and hated was to prove a phenomenon in the history of defeat and conquest the remnants of its military establishment were dismantled its military leaders were imprisoned tried and punished as war criminals its vast industrial complex was in ruins and its people were fearful and uncertain of the future in swift strokes the occupation stripped the emperor of his divinity dismantled the zaibatsu an informal but all-powerful industrial hierarchy based on family ties and instituted reforms that shook the roots of an ancient class society sitting remotely and serenely atop the occupation was the architect of the defeat of the japanese the symbol of their conquest whose power over them exceeded that of the now powerless emperor rightly or wrongly this was the japanese view of general macarthur in september 1945 with the beginning of the occupation of japan the extent to which the soviet union would share it had not been decided on the highest levels taking advantage of this general macarthur rode roughshod over soviet efforts to get a foot in the door it quickly became a standing joke in tokyo that the ranking representative of the soviet union in japan lieut gen kuzma nikolayevich derevyanko spent more time in general macarthur outer office awaiting audiences that never took place than anyone else in the country general derevyanko who had signed the surrender for his country aboard the missouri sought general macarthur ear for a discussion of the soviet role in the occupation but the russians never obtained one general derevyanko went home in the first week of october 1945 and the occupation remained an american affair the occupation moved along through five years during which general macarthur remote but omnipresent moved between his office in the downtown dai ichi building and his residence in the sprawling white stone-and-concrete united states embassy traditionalists were appalled thousands of japanese lined the streets and sidewalks to watch him pass in a long black car four times a day all precedent was shattered and japanese traditionalists were appalled when early in the occupation the emperor called on him at his home the tenno emperor believed by japanese to be a descendant of the sun goddess went as did many others of high station from many nations to pay his respects to the american general two slightly irreverent american newspaper correspondents published a book \"the star- spangled mikado\" which translated into japanese had a wide circulation of the occupation general macarthur made this observation: \"the pages of history in recording america 20th-century contributions may perchance pass over lightly the wars we have fought but i believe they will not fail to record the influence for good upon asia which will inevitably follow the spiritual regeneration of japan\" the serenity of asia was shattered at dawn on the morning of june 25 1950 when north korean troops who had been trained and equipped by russians swept southward across the 38th parallel in a lightning effort to overwhelm the inadequate south korean forces who were being trained under the direction of a united states military advisory team of fewer than 1000 men and officers technically general macarthur was not responsible for the protection of south korea but the fate of the military advisory group their families and several thousand other americans in the country was in doubt step-by-step decisions president truman ordered general macarthur to take whatever steps he thought necessary to evacuate the americans from south korea the civilians were evacuated by sea and air the advisory troops remained with the korean units then general macarthur informed gen lawton collins chief of staff that the south koreans in all probability could not defend themselves successfully in washington decisions were being made hourly as a result of which the united states became step by step involved in the struggle the fifth air force initially assigned to protest the evacuation began to try to support the rapidly retreating south korean forces president truman decided to act on general macarthur recommendation to send united states troops in japan and okinawa into the struggle to stem the communist tide the unequal struggle between the highly trained north korean communist army of 500000 and the ill-prepared south korean army of slightly more than 100000 men soon involved scattered units of american troops swept up hastily from scattered bases in the far east and thrown into the conflict if equal in spirit to the challenge the young postwar gi had little training and less ability to stem the communist tide sweeping under soviet-prepared battle plans down the mountain valleys and into the rice bowl of south korea un joined struggle the united states appealed to the united nations to join the struggle against armed aggression since the soviet union was at that moment boycotting the security council for other reasons and was not present to use its veto the united nations decided to join forces with the south koreans and the united states in the struggle meanwhile one of general macarthur most trusted and competent officers lieut gen walton h walker commanding the united states eighth army was given the task of halting the aggressor several factors were in general walker favor as he sought to build up his forces while fighting bitter rear-guard actions against the invader the north korean air arm was negligible its naval forces were nonexistent; general walker fifth air force support was on constant increase his sea borne supply lines were unhampered he took his stand on the naktong perimeter in august protecting the vital supply port of pusan and ground down the enemy by repulsing with costly casualties its assaults on the defenses on sept 12 1950 general macarthur executed a daring and massive strike from the sea on the north korean rear and flank with an amphibious landing at the western port of inchon north korea defense broke and the remnants of its army fled in disorder across the 38th parallel general macarthur announced that for all practical purposes the war had ended except for the need to pursue the enemy to the yalu river the border between communist china and north korea near the end of september mopping-up operations of north korean communist forces south of the 38th parallel continued while some united nations units their areas cleared of the enemy marked time the taste of victory sent the enthusiasm of united nations forces soaring unit commanders were in favor of pursuing the enemy northward without delay however orders were held in abeyance as word came that there was grave consternation at united nations headquarters as to whether the intent of the combined effort had been to repel the invaders or rid the entire peninsula of communist military forces seated in his tokyo office-command post in the dai ichi building general macarthur marshaled his arguments in support of the pursuit plan for more than three months he had directed the affairs of japan with one hand and conducted the grand strategy of the war with the other deep within his all-but-impenetrable office surrounded by a staff that guarded his time and presence with zeal he read the daily and sometimes hourly battlefront reports on fewer than a dozen occasions he motored to haneda or tachikawa airports outside tokyo boarded his luxuriously appointed four-engine personal transport plane the bataan for a visit to korea and talks with his field commanders except for frequent teletype and telephone conversations with his field commanders general macarthur routine of five years was not visibly affected he came and went between office and residence with the same clockwork regularity while japanese and gi alike gawked at the detached splendor of his passings on oct 10 president truman flew to wake island for a meeting with general macarthur the president appeared to be concerned with the general propensity for independent action at wake island general macarthur was understood to have expressed great optimism about the korean situation he told the president there was \"very little\" chance that the chinese communists or the soviet union would react to a venture into north korea general macarthur returned to tokyo and began to \"close out\" the korean war near the end of october a regimental airborne combat unit was employed in the war only paratroop operation united states paratroopers were dropped at two points just north of the north korean capital of pyongyang to cut off fleeing and disorganized communist units at the same time united nations ground troops slashed across the 38th parallel in a dash to the yalu river korea northern boundary with china but elements identified as chinese communist troops were found south of the 38th parallel in the central and east coast sectors at about the same time--the end of october they had crossed the yalu about oct 16 general macarthur intelligence officers however apparently failed to attach any significance to the reports of their presence second phase of war first cavalry division units reached the river but within hours the chinese communist army struck across the border and the second phase of the korean struggle was under way by the second week in november full-scale warfare had begun and the united nations forces were giving ground at a speed that in many instances amounted to a rout once again at the 38th parallel the united nations forces regrouped and stood their ground for a time later however seoul the south korean capital fell to the communists for the second time what general macarthur had called \"a new war\" went on through the winter and into the spring he became restive and wanted to strike at chinese depots and supply lines within chinese territory he let it be known that he was displeased with high decisions to refrain from attacking outside korea lest the war spread in a message to the american legion he reiterated his vies and in a reply to a request from representative joseph w martin jr the massachusetts republican he set down a position that washington did not believe consonant with its views in the message he said: \"there is no substitute for victory\" in april 1951 he was relieved of his commands in the far east by president truman in his book \"macarthur his rendezvous with history\" the general long time friend and senior aide maj gen courtney whitney recalled the moment general macarthur received the fateful order: \"macarthur face froze not a flicker of emotion crossed it for a moment while his luncheon guests puzzled on what was happening he was stonily silent then he looked up at his wife who still stood with her hand on his shoulder in a gentle voice audible to all present he said: \\'jeannie we\\'re going home at last\\'\" in the message that accompanied his order relieving general macarthur president truman said: \"full and vigorous debate on matters of national policy is a vital element in the constitutional system of our free democracy it is fundamental however that military commanders must be governed by the policies and directives issued to them in the manner prescribed by our laws and constitution in time of crises this consideration is particularly compelling \"general macarthur place in history as one of our greatest commanders is fully established the nation owes him a debt of gratitude for the distinguished and exceptional service which he has rendered his country in posts of great responsibility for that reason i repeat my regret at the necessity for the action i feel compelled to take in this case\" on april 17 the general his wife and son arrived in san francisco his return was that of a conquering hero as city after city feted him with parades beginning may 3 he testified for three days before the armed services and foreign relations committees of the senate insisting he could have won the korean conflict if he had been given a free hand he addressed the joint houses of congress on april 19 creating a deep impression by the moderation of his speech and the dignity of its presentation he ended with a quotation from an old army song--\"old soldiers never die--they just fade away\" he did not fade away however he continued to make speeches and pronouncements his name was brought up before the 1952 republican national convention as a possible presidential nominee he was the keynote speaker but the nomination went to general eisenhower of the united nations he once said: \"it represents perhaps the noblest effort man has yet made to evolve a universal code based upon the highest of moral precepts it became the keystone to an arch of universal hope\" general macarthur and his wife settled in a 37th floor suite of the waldorf towers high above park avenue on aug 1 1952 he was named chairman of the board of remington rand inc now sperry-rand manufacturers of electrical equipment and business machines general whitney remained his inseparable companion and confidant with the death in 1959 of gen george c marshall general macarthur became the senior officer of the united states army in the rank of general of the army he remained on active duty without assignment entitled to a small staff and pay and allowances amounting to $20543 a year in july 1961 general macarthur accompanied by his wife made a sentimental journey to the philippines his only trip abroad following his return to the united states in 1951 additional honors were bestowed upon him by the government there yearly on jan 26 his birthday he joined old comrades at a private dinner in the waldorf to reminisce about the campaigns they had been through delegations of west point cadets called each year to serenade him his only previous serious illness struck him in january 1960 when he underwent surgery for a prostate condition he recovered from the ordeal despite his 80 years general macarthur was married twice his first marriage was to mrs henrietta louise cromwell brooks the divorced wife of walter brooks jr and stepdaughter of edward t stotesbury a wealthy philadelphia banker she obtained a divorced from him in 1929 on the ground that he had failed to support her he was married to jean marie faircloth of murfreesboro tenn april 30 1937 their only child arthur was born in manila on feb 21 1938 arthur

       " \"arthur rubinstein one of the greatest pianists of the century died quietly in his sleep at his home in geneva yesterday he was 95 years old for about 85 of those years he had been playing the piano in public and he lived to see himself win the highest acclaim he started at the age of 3 made his debut shortly thereafter and was still playing until about five years ago in his youth he was eclipsed by such giants as sergei rachmaninoff and josef hofmann but as the pianists of an older generation died and as mr rubinstein went on from strength to strength he became the most popular pianist before the public and the most respected his only rival was vladimir horowitz in his autobiography mr rubinstein conceded that mr horowitz was the better pianist but not the better musician mr horowitz however was absent from the public from 1952 to 1965 and in those years rubinstein had no real rival idolized all over the world possible competitors such as sviatoslav richter did not play that often in the west and the legendary eccentric arturo benedetti michelangeli gave relatively few concerts mr rubinstein had the international field pretty much to himself and was idolized all over the world in the pantheon of 20th-century pianists mr rubinstein place is assured as one of the titans with his remarkable technique golden tone and musical logic with the elan he brought to his interpretations with his natural unforced and unflurried style he was unique - as indeed every great artist is what mr rubinstein offered above all others was the ability to transmit the joy of music ''what good are vitamins'' mr rubinstein demanded when he was asked at the age of 75 to explain his youthful vivacity and fire ''eat a lobster eat a pound of caviar - live! if you are in love with a beautiful blonde with an empty face and no brains at all don't be afraid marry her! live!'' the great pianist conscientiously applied the prescription to himself and everything he did was con brio there was dash to his rich mode of life just as there was to his making of sumptuous music from his earliest to his latest days he was the embodiment of the grand manner even at an age when most musical artists slow down he was giving concerts on an average of one every three days; he was recording furiously out of his vast repertory; he was the life of innumerable parties and luncheons; he was the irrepressible talker and raconteur; he was ineffably rubinstein the supreme and serious musician that most americans knew was rubinstein since 1937 the year of his historic reappearance at carnegie hall that marked a new dedication to his art ''it is said of me that when i was young i divided my time impartially among wine women and song'' he remarked afterward ''i deny this categorically ninety percent of my interests were women'' there was an element of exaggeration to this comment but it was certainly true that the post-1937 rubinstein was a mature artist his special fusion of romanticism and intellectualism caught the public fancy audiences could not hear enough of him; his concerts were standing-room only; his recordings sold in the millions; he performed all over the world at fees of $6000 and more a concert then the highest fee for any artist before the public chopin a specialty rubinstein moved with confident ease through a repertory ''my musical valise'' that started with mozart proceeded through beethoven and the entire 19th century and wound up with such moderns as heitor villa-lobos igor stravinsky and karol szymanowski chopin however was his specialty and it was a chopinist that he was considered by many without peer as superb an interpreter of chopin as he was he counted himself also as a mozart man he returned to mozart ''on my knees'' in late life undeniably part of the rubinstein manner and mystique was his pianistic pedigree which went back to many legendary 19th-century musicians rubinstein first big-name enthusiast was joseph joachim the violinist friend of brahms his early piano training came from karl heinrich barth a pupil of franz liszt who had been taught by carl czerny who had in turn been a pupil of beethoven rubinstein moreover drew personally from such titans as camille saint-saens ignace jan paderewski eugene ysaye claude debussy cesar franck artur schnabel and vladimir de pachmann played 'crowd pleasers' in his youth rubinstein tended to perform what he called ''the crowd pleasers'' - tchaikovsky rachmaninoff and liszt - and his piano belched fire with maturity however he turned more and more to chopin his fellow pole whose compositions of delicate expression called for an artist who could make the piano breathe rubinstein was so spontaneous and exuberant that he declined to think of his artistry as work ''i can play 10 hours'' he remarked in his late 70 ''i don't feel that making art should be called work work is something disagreeable that you have to do'' that statement like so many of rubinstein about himself was true and not true; for this most gifted of pianists worked very hard by any other standards than his own to perfect and project his artistry even if he liked to create the impression that it was all effortless as it indeed sounded to audiences in a recording session for rca victor records in webster hall here he would play and replay a piece until he was satisfied that it was his best; and before a concert he would practice particularly passages that he thought he might have difficulty with nothing less than perfection was tolerated practice for its own sake however was not rubinstein notion of how to extract music from the printed notes ''i was born very very lazy and i don't always practice very long'' he said once ''but i must say in my defense that it is not so good in a musical way to overpractice when you do the music seems to come out of your pocket if you play with a feeling of 'oh i know this' you play without that little drop of fresh blood that is necessary -and the audience feels it'' on another occasion he explained in his tumbling english his philosophy this way: ''at every concert i leave a lot to the moment i must have the unexpected the unforeseen i want to risk to dare i want to be surprised by what comes out i want to enjoy it more than the audience that way the music can bloom anew it like making love the act is always the same but each time it different'' happiness in performance one of the elements of freshness in a rubinstein concert was also the evident happiness with which he played ''don't tell hurok'' - sol hurok his impresario of many years - he admonished one interviewer ''but i'd play the piano for nothing i enjoy it so much'' this was of the essence of the pianist attitude toward life generally which he expressed by saying: ''happiness is to live it is the only happiness possible'' this total joie de vivre undoubtedly lent a special quality to rubinstein music ''music is not a hobby not even a passion with me; music is me'' and lifted him above his contemporaries moreover underneath his panache he possessed insight and a capacity for musical growth tht markedly enriched the work of his later years for example he recorded the schumann ''carnaval'' at 65; and when he recorded the piece 10 years later ''there was no question but that it was a better performance'' in the opinion of harold c schonberg then the new york times music critic ''his colleagues consider him a miracle geriatric experts mumble when they talk about him and nobody will put up much of an argument when he is called the greatest living pianist'' mr schonberg wrote on rubinstein 75th birthday he continued: ''vladimir horowitz may have a more glittering technique rudolf serkin may have a better way with german music rosalyn tureck more of an affinity for bach sviatoslav richter for prokofiev and scriabin and claudio arrau may have a bigger repertory ''but no pianist has put everything together the way rubinstein has others may be superior in specific things but rubinstein is the complete pianist'' presence of majesty to see and hear rubinstein at a concert was to be in the presence of majesty a 5-foot-8-inch figure resembling a cube on sticks in impeccable evening clothes strode briskly on stage and received the homage that his subjects' thunderous applause connoted he bowed slightly from the waist and his pearl-gray hair glistened in the stage lights and his blue eyes darted around the hall before the applause subsided he seated himself on the piano bench and carefully draped the tails of his coat over its back then he raised his face masked in concentration until his nose tilted upward at a 45-degree angle his back was erect he kneaded his fingers he bowed his head for a moment as the last coughs died out and then he eased into the keyboard sometimes in playing he seemed about to overwhelm the instrument as he rose off the bench; other times when the music was lyrical he moved his arms and hands in graceful symmetry his eyes appeared fixed on a distant object ''i like to look up over the piano'' he explained 'o i can listen and follow the lines of the piece looking at your fingers for accuracy is too confusing i'd rather miss a few notes than play by phrase instead of as a whole'' rubinstein sound or tone was elegant one critic described it as ''a firm clear colorful sonority that is one of the miracles of 20th-century pianism'' ''he simply cannot produce an ugly forced or jagged sound no matter how heavily he comes down on the keyboard'' this observer continued ''as soon as his fingers touch the keys one knows that the old master is at work; and the penetrating tone rolls out and fills the house'' ingredients of tone the pianist himself did not know how to account for the distinctiveness of his tone contributing to it however was his physique considered perfect for a pianist his torso was short and muscular; his arms were long his biceps those of a blacksmith and his fists like a longshoreman he would spread his spatulate fingers whose tips were calloused from years at the keyboard to encompass the 12 notes from c to g -two more than normal moreover his pinkies were nearly as long as his index fingers and his elongate thumbs extended downward at an obtuse angle another ingredient of rubinstein was an unusually fine ear that among other things permitted him to spin music through his mind ''at breakfast i might pass a brahms symphony in my head'' he said ''then i am called to the phone and half an hour later i find it been going on all the time and i'm in the third movement'' this phenomenon was the basis for a game rubinstein friends like to play with him in which they would randomly name musical excerpts that he would then play he was seldom stumped ''rubinstein is the only pianist you could wake up at midnight and ask to play any of the 38 major piano concertos'' according to edouard van remoortel the conductor the pianist was usually labeled a romantic but that was an error in the opinion of many critics mr schonberg for example wrote: ''rubinstein today is called - mistakenly - a romanticist and he is - in relation to the younger pianists just as he was a classicist in relation to the older ones today new style is represented by the young spit-and-polish pianists who never hit a wrong note who come to music with the utmost dedication and who all tend to sound alike'' a born extrovert if rubinstein had not been a pianist his friends were certain that he could have made an enjoyable living as a stand-up comedian and raconteur a born extrovert he loved to meet people to act out his stories and to tell them in the eight languages in which he was fluent - english polish russian french german italian spanish and portuguese when he told a story he performed all the roles with appropriate facial expressions and gestures -climbing atop a chair or table and beating time if the anecdote were about a conductor or simpering coquettishly if it were about a young woman even lighting a cigar he prudently laid in a big stock of upmann just before the united states break with cuba was an act worth watching one of his stories concerned the time he and albert einstein played a violin and piano sonata the physicist missed a cue in one passage and came in four beats late they started again and once more einstein missed the cue rubinstein turned to his partner in mock exasperation and exclaimed ''for god sakes professor can't you even count up to four'' in another rubinstein story which he delighted to tell on himself he was making a recording in webster hall when a porter in overalls carrying a pail and mop came up to the piano watched silently and then asked ''do you do this professionally'' rubinstein always said that at this point he was for the only time in his life nonplussed in addition to a sensitive appreciation of the best in cigars haute cuisine and wines the pianist was a connoisseur of painting who was able to say ''i knew picasso before he was picasso and i was rubinstein'' apart from his picassos rubinstein collection was dominated by vuillards chagalls and dufys rubinstein start in life was much more modest than his eventual eminence born in lodz poland on jan 28 1887 he was the youngest of seven children of ignace rubinstein a textile producer and felicia heyman rubinstein late in life rubinstein became vain about his age and advanced his birth date to 1889 according to those who knew him he took piano lessons at the age of 3 and at 4 he was performing in public and flourishing a calling card that read ''artur the great piano virtuoso'' a little later tired of being asked if he were a relative of the great anton rubinstein he inscribed the words ''no relation'' on the cards by the time he was 8 he had exhausted the teaching resources of the warsaw conservatory of music and was sent to berlin to perform for joachim the violinist impressed by the boy precocity the friend of brahms and schumann assumed responsibility for his study he was indeed the conductor at rubinstein berlin debut at the age of 11 there followed recitals in dresden hamburg warsaw where he played under the baton of emil mlynarski his future father-in-law and a visit to paderewski in switzerland among paderewski guests was a boston critic who brought rubinstein to the attention of the knabe piano company which underwrote his first american tour in 1906 his showpiece was saint-saens concerto no 2 in g for piano and orchestra which he performed at carnegie hall the tour lasted 75 concerts and it was not a critical success he returned to europe disheartened he went back to school so to speak by playing in private for paderewski ''i just played and listened and he would tell me little things'' rubinstein recalled he did not return to the concert stage until 1910 he lived in paris had a series of love affairs became friends with artists and writers ''i had often lobster and champagne and often i had nothing'' he said ''once i spent two days on a park bench because i could not pay my hotel bill but i also had wonderful chamber music with ysaye and thibaud and casals'' recitals for allied cause back as a performer rubinstein established himself in europe as a top-ranking pianist in the early part of world war i he gave recitals for the allied cause at that time he became so enraged with the german treatment of the poles and the belgians that he vowed never to appear in germany and he never thereafter did a turning point in rubinstein career came in 1916 when he made a tour of spain it was a grand success four concerts stretched to 125 and from there he went to south america ''they loved me for my improvised way of playing'' he recalled ''it was not really intentional with me because i could not even then work out a conception and stick to it but to them it was a relief from what they called 'the pedants' '' convinced that he would now be a hit in the united states he reappeared in carnegie hall in 1919 but his reception was lukewarm ''when i played in the latin countries they loved me because of my temperament'' he said later ''but when i played in england and america they felt that because they had paid their money they were entitled to hear all the notes i dropped too many notes in those days and they felt they were cheated'' rebuffed but not chastened he returned to europe where he divided his time between concerts and high living with the international set he was

       " 'william mckinley the twenty-fifth president of the united states was born in niles trumbull country ohio on jan 29 1843 his father william mckinley sr came to ohio from pennsylvania the family was scotch-irish and the president forefathers came to america 150 years ago authentic records trace the mckinlays in scotland back to 1547 and it has been claimed by those who have made a study of the president lineage that james mckinlay \"the trooper\" was one of his ancestors major mckinley at a gathering of the mckinlay clan an association embracing fully 300 people at the columbian world fair in chicago in 1893 explained to one who claimed a common lineage with him despite the difference in the spelling of their names how the \"a\" in the name of his ancestors became an \"e\" in his \"your ancestors of the mckinlay clan\" said he \"came to this country directly from scotland while mine came from the north of ireland; but we are probably of the same original covenanter stock\" the crest of the mckinlay clan was a mailed hand holding an olive branch and its motto \"not too much\" the president career seems to have been modeled on this motto a gallant soldier himself his disposition has always been toward peace he was the last man to hold out against the war with spain yet when it was forced against him he quickly demonstrated as senator foraker once remarked in a public speech that \"he understood the business\" youth and war william was the seventh child in the family of nine his first education was received in the public schools of niles but when he was nine years of age his parents removed to poland mahoning county ohio a town which was at that time well known for its educational facilities there he was admitted into union seminary and pursued his studies until he was seventeen excelling in most of his studies he was especially noted for his brilliancy in debate he evinced a lively interest in all the great public questions of the day and his speeches upon them were worthy of a much more matured mind his application was intense and soon his health was so undermined that he was obliged to return home for rest and recuperation but even then he did not escape a severe illness when his health was restored he did not return to school but sought and obtained a place as a teacher in the public schools of the kerr district near poland it was at this period that he joined the methodist episcopal church he became a diligent student of the bible and was a frequent participant in the discussions in the bible class of the poland methodist church to which he belonged his career really began at the outbreak of the civil war at that time he was a clerk in the poland post office a war meeting was held in the sparrow tavern at the close of a patriotic speech by an eloquent speaker a call was made for volunteers young mckinley was among those who stepped forward he went with the recruits to columbus and was there enlisted as a private in company e of the twenty-third ohio volunteer infantry this regiment numbered among its field and staff officers william s rosecrans after major general and rutherford b hayes nineteenth president of the united states the life of a soldier was beneficial to young mckinley health during the fourteen months he served as a private he developed from a slip of a boy to a robust young man he participated in all the early engagements in west virginia the first of these being at carnifex ferry in the winter camp at fayetteville he earned and received his first promotion--commissary sergeant it was while he was acting in this capacity that the \"coffee incident\" of which an attempt was made to create ridicule in his first campaign for the presidency occurred far from being a subject of ridicule it was an incident which reflected the highest credit upon the young officer the \"coffee incident\" at the battle of antietam while his regiment was in the thick of the fray sergt mckinley was in charge of the commissary department of his brigade and necessarily his post of duty was with the supplies about two miles from where his famished comrades were battling with the enemy enlisting stragglers to help him sergt mckinley filled two wagons with cans containing hot coffee and other supplies and hurried them to the front the mules of one wagon became disabled under the terrific fire but the plucky young officer undaunted continued his efforts and finally reached his regiment with the supplies being received with tremendous cheers col hayes was badly wounded at south mountain and when he went home he told the story to gov tod the governor was so impressed with it that he at once requested that a lieutenant commission be made out for mckinley this was done the commission dating from sept 24 1862 gen hayes in describing this incident in a speech at the lakeside chautauqua in 1891 said: \"from sergt mckinley hand every man in the regiment was served with hot coffee and warm meats a thing which had never occurred under similar circumstances in any other army in the world he passed under fire and delivered with his own hands those things so essential to the men for whom he was laboring\" while he was a second lieutenant mckinley regiment participated in a number of minor engagements in all of which he showed great gallantry on feb 7 1863 he received his commission as first lieutenant it was under his leadership that his company was the first to scramble over the fortifications at camp platt and silence the enemy guns it was at the battle of kernstown near winchester that he gained his greatest military distinction crook army was attacked by early crook had but 6000 men while early had 20000 gen hayes had charge of the first brigade he was on the extreme right and was soon attacked with such fury that he was obliged to fall back toward winchester the movement was successfully executed except that the thirteenth west virginia regiment failed to retire and was in imminent danger of capture lieut mckinley was ordered to go and bring the regiment away if it had not already fallen into the hands of the enemy it was a mission fraught with the gravest peril as he urged his horse through the open fields over fences and across ditches the fire of the enemy was poured out upon him once he was completely enveloped in the smoke of an exploding shell and his comrades who were watching his gallant ride with the gravest anxiety thought he had surely gone down but when the smoke had cleared away they saw him sitting erect in his saddle and pressing on he delivered his orders and the regiment was rescued after a desperate conflict with overwhelmingly superior forces as mckinley came back with the regiment he was cheered by the whole brigade col hayes was filled with emotion on seeing him he loved mckinley as a father and when he sent him on his perilous mission he truly believed as he said to the lieutenant on greeting him and as he afterward said in many public addresses that he would never see him alive again that very same night lieut mckinley led a party of volunteers to rescue four guns and some caissons which were in imminent danger of falling into the hands of the enemy it was a most dangerous piece of work gallantly accomplished the next day july 25 1864 at the age of twenty-one mckinley was promoted to be a captain in a fierce engagement at berryville on sept 3 1864 capt mckinley horse was shot under him at opequan and fisher hill he again distinguished himself soon after the battle of fisher hill his regiment was detailed as a train guard to martinsburg on the march the men voted capt mckinley first ballot was cast for lincoln whose career his own was to parallel so closely even to assassination mckinley was with sheridan at the battle of winchester for a time he was on the staff of gen hancock later he was assigned as acting assistant adjutant general on the staff of gen samuel s carroll commanding the veteran reserve corps at washington where he remained through that exciting period which included the surrender of lee to grant at appamattox and the assassination of president lincoln it was just a month before mr lincoln fell a victim to an assassin bullet that mckinley received from him a document which he has always considered one of his most precious possessions it is a commission as a major by brevet in the volunteer army of the united states \"for gallant and meritorious services at the battles of opequan cedar creek and fisher hill\" signed \"a lincoln\" major mckinley participated in the final act of the great war drama the grand review in washington at the close of the war although a military career was open to him he decided to leave the army on his return to poland a complimentary dinner was tendered to him by the citizens who took a pride in his military achievements he at once began the stud of the law entering the office of judge charles e glidden at youngstown ohio after one year study under the preceptorship of judge glidden he went to law school in albany ny and in march 1867 was admitted to the bar at warren ohio practice of law begun on the advice of his sister anna he decided to settle at canton which has since been his home he always manifested a keen interest in politics and in the same year that he located in canton his first political speeches were made he was elected prosecuting attorney of stark county in 1869 overcoming a large democratic majority he was renominated but missed re-election by 45 votes resuming his private practice he soon built up a profitable business but in all campaigns he was in constant demand as a speaker mr mckinley was married to miss ida saxton on jan 25 1871 miss saxton grandparents were among the founders of canton nearly a century ago her father was one of the prominent bankers of the city her father means enabled her to have every advantage of education and travel and she had grown into a young woman of many accomplishments mr saxton was a man of practical ideas while educating his daughter for the social position which his wealth and standing in the community opened up to her he at the same time desired to guard her against possible adversity by giving her a business training accordingly he took her into the bank as cashier a position which she filled for some years with ability it was while she was cashier in her father bank that william mckinley made her acquaintance her beauty and her position in society naturally attracted many admirers but her preference for the rising young lawyer was soon marked she was a teacher in the presbyterian sunday school while young mckinley was teaching in the methodist sunday school during their courtship he always accompanied her to her church before going to his own miss saxton parents made no objection to the man of her choice and after a brief courtship they were married through all their married life they have remained happy and their devotion to each other has proved an example to the whole american people two children were born to them--katie on christmas day 1871 and ida in 1873 both died in early childhood since their death mrs mckinley has been an invalid her dependence upon her husband has been a matter of tender pathos to all who know them and his tenderness and devotion to her has greatly added to the admiration of the american people for him it was in 1876 that mr mckinley was first nominated for congress he was elected by 3300 majority during the progress of this canvass he visited the cy over gov campbell the democractic candidate for re-election was decisive and he polled the largest vote so far cast for governor in the history of ohio campbell had been elected in 1889 by 11000 plurality; mckinley defeated him by 21500 soon after his election as governor the presidential campaign began gov mckinley was elected a delegate at large to the convention when the delegates gathered at minneapolis the contest was apparently between harrison and blaine mckinley came out for harrison the opponents of the president when they found blaine chances were not all they had hoped started a boom for mckinley whose position was then one unexampled in the history of politics in this country he was the presiding officer of the convention when the attempt was made to stampede the delegates for him it was a most trying situation but he bore himself with coolness and decision when ohio recorded two votes for him he challenged the vote so as to put himself on record for harrison when the roll call was complete harrison received 535 votes blaine 182 mckinley 182 and reed 4 leaving the chair mr mckinley mounted a seat in the ohio delegation and moved to make the nomination of harrison unanimous gov mckinley campaign tour through the west for harrison was one of the marvels of the time he made 325 speeches in 300 different towns for over eight weeks he averaged more than seven speeches a day he traveled over 16000 miles and addressed more than 2000000 people on the expiration of his term as governor he returned to his old home in canton where he lived quietly for six months then the campaign for the presidency was begun and all over the country republican enthusiasm sprung up for mckinley it was soon evident that the honor which twice before might have been his but for his high sense of loyalty was now to be thrust upon him in the republican national convention held in st louis in 1896 he was nominated on the first ballot; and in the ensuing election he received a popular vote of 7104770 a plurality of 601854 over his principal opponent william jennings bryan in the electoral college he received 271 votes against 176 for bryan the first administration two facts of highest historical importance marked mr mckinley first four years as president spain withdrew its flag from this hemisphere and gold was declared by statute to be the sole legal standard of value the acquisition of hawaii as a territory and of the transpacific islands as possessions almost deserve to be bracketed and would have distinguished other administrations but in his case they were logical and subsidiary upon both of the important developments he took his positions by a process of growth in june 1897 he was subject to democratic criticism for the slowness of his action regarding cuba in december came his proclamation through secretary sherman regarding the distress and destitution prevailing under the spanish administration with the appeal for charitable relief this was done only after consultation with the spanish minister dupuy de lome it was not until after the maine was sunk that a hostile tone marked his official utterance on march 28 he transmitted to congress the report of the court of inquiry concluding: \"i do not permit myself to doubt that the sense of justice of the spanish nation will dictate a course of action suggested by honor and the friendly relations of the two governments\" on april 7 he received the joint representations of the diplomats of europe appealing to the \"humanity and moderation\" of the united states in its dealings with spain if england had not participated in the representation harm might have been done but the participation of england robbed the innovation of all hostile significance and a most tactful reply was made he \"appreciated the disinterested character\" of the communication and relied upon a similar appreciation of the motives of the united states on april 11 followed his message to congress advising armed intervention after a description of weyler policy of extermination for the reasons of general humanity protection for american citizens and property and the general national welfare congress promptly responded giving the authority requested by a unanimous vote $50000000 was placed in his sole control for purposes of national defense this was done quite casually sundry appropriations were made for printing and binding in amounts of five figures then followed three lines providing for the beginning of the war from funds in the treasury not otherwise appropriated events marched rapidly on april 22 the blockade of cuba was proclaimed by him and on june 27 he sent his message advising the reward of hobson and his almost forgotten companions newcomb powell and hodgson for their bravery at santiago the first week of the following january came his message communicating the treaty of paris and peace his hastily sketched official connection with the cuban war may be said to end with his order for the burial of the soldier dead on april 4 his currency record only july 24 1897 president mckinley sent to congress a message recommending the appointment of a non-partisan monetary commission he repeated the words of his inaugural and in due course followed the appointment of the resultless wolcott commission he was far from escaping reproach for his sincerity and consistency but looking backward in perspective it seems as though his influence upon those more heretical and weak-hearted than himself was quite as great as though he had been so far in advance of them as to have lost his influence through lack of touch with those whose support was essential to action he recurred to the subject with renewed vigor in his message to the first session of the fifty-sixth congress making it the leading topic and the bill which became law was introduced in the house on dec 4 1890 the senate proposed a substitute and there was a legislative wrangle which is no part of his personal record he cast his unofficial as well as his official influence into the scale as for example by his interviews with senator chandler and h h hanna who gave publicity to his words in an influential manner mr mckinley utterances upon the attitude of the united states toward its dependencies or \"territorial possessions\" are scattered all through his public documents since the peace with spain and also in a notable series of addresses at boston ocean grove chicago and minneapolis here also as in financial questions he felt his taking no step unnecessarily and each in logical succession to its predecessor upon tariff matters it is almost unnecessary to indicate--so fresh is the memory of his speech the day before he was shot--how he changed with the times mckinleyism and a high tariff are familiar synonyms he was said to have worn a suit of american weave upon inauguration day be way of proof how the tariff develops home industries yet under him no less than ten reciprocity treaties have been negotiated and unanimously checked in the senate the contrast is eloquent mr mckinley speeches which are not of public record are among the most notable of presidential utterances upon a southern tour in 1897 there as comment and controversy over his alleged wearing of a confederate badge this spirit of tolerance was further displayed in his speech at atlanta in december 1897 when he pronounced the very last words over the grave of sectionalism',\n",

this city on march 17 1905 they had five children: james anna who became mrs curtis b dall of new york and later mrs john boettiger; elliot franklin d jr and john a roosevelt the year 1910 was a turning point in politics in this state when after a generation of republican rule at the capitol the democrats took over control of both the executive branch of the state government and the legislative the period found the youthful roosevelt then only 28 running for state senator from his home district made up of the counties of dutchess where the roosevelts lived columbia and putnam normally a strong republican district mr roosevelt carried it two years later he was re-elected by an even more substantial majority when the time had come to stand for re-election mr roosevelt was confined to a sickbed and the fight was made for him by the late col henry mchenry howe colonel howe who became secretary to the president when mr roosevelt assumed office was largely instrumental through management of the pre-convention campaign activities in obtaining for his chief the presidential nomination in 1932 colonel howe died in 1935 leads insurgent group almost unknown outside the district the young democratic senator from dutchess went to albany to take his seat soon after jan 1 1911 before many days he had attracted nation-wide attention by assuming the leadership of a group of insurgents in the legislature which he had mustered and which revolted against tammany hall and its leader charles f murphy then at the heyday of his power over a tammany proposal to send william f blue-eyed billy sheehan to the united states senate it was the last time a united states senator was elected in this state by joint ballot of the legislature the republicans in a minority were pledged to the re-election of chauncey m depew at its beginning the fight started by young roosevelt seemed a forlorn hope the insurgent group was in a small minority and with the caucus resorted to the election of mr sheehan seemed certain despite a state-wide wave of protest against his election on the ground that he was too close to mr murphy and indeed to the tammany organization but prior to the caucus the nineteen democratic legislators of the insurgent group bound themselves to oppose the election of mr sheehan to the end they held the balance of power on a joint ballot they remained out of the caucus nothing that mr murphy could do or say made any difference to mr roosevelt and his insurgent flock for sixty ballots and almost three months the conflict raged the insurgents had a candidate of their own edward m shepard with mr sheehan he was killed off in the contest which ended in an honorable compromise with the election of james a o\\'gorman on the sixty-fourth ballot from this period dated the first acquaintance of franklin d roosevelt and alfred e smith who was democratic floor leader and later became speaker of the assembly fought tammany as senator all through his service in the state senate franklin d roosevelt fought tammany then firmly in control of both branches of the legislature he voted for a direct primary bill although it was but a half-way measure grudgingly supported by tammany he opposed a number of tammany grab bills tammany hall was opposed to the nomination of woodrow wilson for president and the delegation from this state was lined up for champ clark then speaker of the house of representatives anti-tammany democrats throughout the state however favored mr wilson and franklin d roosevelt took his stand with this group at baltimore where the 1912 democratic national convention was held mr roosevelt although not a delegate was active in behalf of mr wilson who was nominated and elected in that year of the bull moose exodus from the republican party led by another roosevelt his reward after woodrow wilson had taken office was the appointment to be assistant secretary of the navy the world war broke out in 1914 about fifteen months after mr roosevelt had become assistant secretary of the navy but in advance of hostilities in europe and the entry of the united states into the great conflict the wilson democrats in this state had a score to settle with tammany hall he was the candidate of the anti-tammany wing for the united states senator in the democratic primary held sept 28 1914 but was defeated by james w gerard later ambassador to germany sought to sway hoover in washington during the years that followed he was drawn into close and friendly relations with herbert hoover who was to be an opponent in the 1932 fight over the presidency mr roosevelt sought to prevail upon mr hoover to become a democrat with a view to grooming him for the democratic nomination for president in 1924 and actually thought he had succeeded when republicans of prominence managed to persuade mr hoover that he would profit politically by becoming a republican the rest is history came 1920 and another presidential contest the democrats nominated gov james m cox of ohio for the first place on their ticket mr roosevelt drew second place the campaign that followed was fought on the wilson record during his two administrations and on the league of nations the republicans having taken their stand definitely against the united states joining the league a keen believer in the wilson policies and the peace mission of the league mr roosevelt took up the party fight he toured the country in a special train and kept up the fighting until the eve of the election friends of mr roosevelt gave him credit for something like 1000 speeches short and long in the course of his campaign for the vice presidency the republican landslide marked mr roosevelt second defeat for public office he had won two with five children to rear mr roosevelt returned to the practice of law resuming a partnership with the firm of emmet marvin & amp; roosevelt he also accepted a position as vice president with the fidelity and deposit company of maryland at about that time too he was elected an overseer at harvard he also undertook the task of reorganizing the boy scout organization in the country and he became chairman of a committee created to raise funds for the woodrow wilson foundation stricken by paralysis then in august 1921 came his tragic illness of infantile paralysis which at first threatened to end his career and possibly even his life but which later came to be regarded as the turning point from which began his upward climb to the white house with members of his family he was swimming near his summer home at campobello nb when he was stricken the next day he felt a stiffness as if a cold were coming on on the second morning he could not get out of bed his leg muscles were paralyzed the attack was serious it was with extreme difficulty that he was brought back to new york where he could receive the most skillful medical treatment obtainable for months his life was despaired of then the progress of the dread disease was arrested after a truly epic fight for health he began to recover the optimism which was a cardinal trait in his make-up his patience and his courage were powerful allies in the battle he was paralyzed from the waist down it was almost a year before he could move about at all with the aid of crutches but he never gave in to a man in love with outdoor life swimming sailing tennis and riding the ordeal was doubly trying it was at this time that he \"discovered\" warm springs ga and the health-giving qualities of its waters in cases such as his he went to warm springs and spent much time swimming in the pool gradually he regained in part the use of his legs he discarded his crutches and was able to move about with the aid of canes and steel braces which had been fitted to his lower limbs the process of recovery however took years',\n",

controversial combative he created critics as well as loyalists but he never deviated from his opinions commented on debut in his autobiography \"i never had it made\" to be published next month by g

anthem i have learned that i remain a black in a white world\" describing his struggle he wrote: \"i had to fight hard against loneliness abuse and the knowledge that any mistake i made would be magnified because i was the only black man out there many people resented my impatience and honesty but i never cared about acceptance as much as i cared about respect\" his belligerence flared throughout his career in baseball business and politics \"i was told that it would cost me some awards\" he said last year \"but if i had to keep quiet to get an award it wasn\\'t worth it awards are great but if i got one for being a nice kid what good is it\" to other black ballplayers though he was most often saluted as the first to run the gantlet monte irvin who played for the new york giants while robinson was with the dodgers and who now is an assistant to the commissioner of baseball said yesterday: \"jackie robinson opened the door of baseball to all men he was the first to get the

rickey experiment as i call it the original idea would not have come about as successfully with anybody other than mr rickey\" he often said \"the most important results of it are that it produced understanding among whites and it gave black people the idea that if i could do it they could do it too that blackness wasn\\'t subservient to anything\" among his disappointments was the fact that he never was afforded an opportunity to be a major -league manager \"i had no future with the dodgers because i was too closely identified with branch rickey \"he once said \"after the club was taken over by walter o\\'malley you couldn\\'t even mention mr rickey name in front of him i considered mr rickey the greatest human being i had ever known\" robinson kept baseball in perspective ebbets field the brooklyn ballpark that was the stage for his drama was leveled shortly after mr o\\'malley moved the dodger franchise to los angeles in 1958 apartment houses replaced it years later asked what he felt about ebbets field he replied: \"i don\\'t feel anything they need those apartments more than they need a monument to the memory of baseball i\\'ve had my thrills\" he also had his heartbreak his older son jackie jr died in 1971 at the age of 24 in an automobile accident on the merritt parkway not far from the family home in stamford son became drug addict three years earlier jackie jr had been arrested for heroin possession his addiction had begun while he served in the army in vietnam where he was wounded he was convicted and ordered to undergo treatment at the daytop drug abuse center in seymour conn cured he worked at daytop helping other addicts until his fatal accident robinson and his wife rachel had two other children--david and sharon \"you don\\'t know what it like\" robinson said at the time \"to lose a son find him and lose him again my problem was my inability to spend much time at home i thought my family was secure so i went running around everyplace else i guess i had more of an effect on other people kids than i did my own\" with the dodgers he had other problems his arrival in 1947 prompted racial insults from some opponents an aborted strike by the st louis cardinals an alleged deliberate spiking by enos slaughter of the cardinals and stiffness from a few teammates notable fred dixiewalker a popular star from georgia \"dixie was very difficult at the start\" robinson acknowledged \"but he was the first guy on the ballclub to come to me with advice and help for my hitting i knew why--if i helped the ballclub it put money in his pocket i knew he didn\\'t like me any more in those few short months but he did come forward\" a cautioning by rickey as a rookie robinson had been warned by mr rickey of the insults that would occur he also was urged by mr rickey to hold his temper he complied but the following season as an established player he began to argue with the umpires and duel verbally with opponents in the traditional give-and-take of baseball as the years passed robinson developed a close relationship with many teammates \"after the game we went our separate ways\" he explained \"but on the field there was that understanding no one can convince me that the things that happened on the ballclub didn\\'t affect people the old dodgers were something special but of my teammates overall there was nobody like pee wee reese for me\" in boston once some braves\\' players were taunting robinson during infield practice reese the popular shortstop who came from louisville moved to the rescue \"pee wee walked over and put his arm on my shoulder as if to say \"this is my teammate whether you like it or not\\'\" robinson said \"another time all our white players got letters saying if they don\\'t do something the whole team will be black and they\\'ll lose their jobs on the bust to the ballpark that night pee wee brought it up and we discussed it pretty soon we were all laughing about it\" in clubhouse debates robinson voice had a sharp angry tone that rose with his emotional involvement \"robinson\" he once was told by don newcombe a star pitcher who was also black \"not only are you wrong you\\'re loud wrong\" as a competitor robinson was the dodgers\\' leader in his 10 seasons they won six national league pennants--1947 1949 1952 1953 1955 and 1956 they lost another in the 1951 playoff with the new york giants and another to the philadelphia phillies on the last day of the 1950 season in 1949 when he batted 342 to win the league title and drove in 124 runs he was voted the league most valuable player award in 1947 he had been voted the rookie of the year batted 311 lifetime \"the only way to beat the dodgers\" said warren giles then the president of the cincinnati reds later the national league president \"is to keep robinson off the bases\" he had a career batting average of 311 primarily a line drive hitter he accumulated only 137 home runs with a high of 19 in both 1951 and 1952 but on a team with such famous sluggers as duke snider gil hodges and roy campanella who was also black he was the cleanup hitter fourth in the batting order a tribute to his ability to mover along teammates on base but his personality flared best as a baserunner he had a total of 197 stolen bases he stole home 11 times the most by any player in the post-world war ii era ran like football player \"i think the most symbolic part of jackie robinson ball player\" he once reflected \"was making the pitcher believe he was going to the next base i think he enjoyed that the most too i think my value to the dodgers was disruption--making the pitcher concentrate on me instead of on my teammate who was at bat at the time\" in the 1955 world series he stole home against the new york yankees in the opening game of brooklyn only world series triumph pigeon-toed and muscular wearing no 42 he ran aggressively typical of his college football training as a star runner and passer at the university of california at los angeles in 1939 and 1940 he ranked second in the pacific coast conference in total offense in 1940 with 875 yards- -440 rushing and 435 passing born in cairo ga on jan 31 1919 he was soon taken to pasadena calif by his mother with her four other children after his father had deserted them he developed into an all-round athlete competing in basketball and track in addition to baseball and football after attending ucla he entered the army he was commissioned a second lieutenant after his discharge he joined the kansas city monarchs of the negro national league as a short stop \"but if mr rickey hadn\\'t signed me i wouldn\\'t have played another year in the black league\" he said \"it was too difficult the travel was brutal financially there was no reward it took everything you made to live off\" if he had quit the black leagues without having been signed by mr rickey what would he have done \"i more than likely would have gone to coach baseball at sam houston college my minister had gone down there to texas as president of the college that was about the only thing a black athlete had left then a chance to coach somewhere at a small black college\" instead his presence turned the dodgers into the favorite of black people throughout the nation \"they picked up 20 million fans instantly\" said bill russell the famous center of the boston celtics who was professional basketball first black coach \"but to most black people jackie was a man not a ballplayer he did more for baseball than baseball did for him he was someone that young black athlete could look up to\" as the dodgers toured the national league they set attendance records but the essence of robinson competitive fury occurred in a 1954 game at ebbets field with the rival giants sal maglie the giants\\' ace who was known as \"the barber\" because of his tendency to \"shave\" a batter head with his fast ball and sharp-breaking curve was intimidating the dodger hitters in the dodger dugout reese the team captain spoke to the 6-foot 195-pound robinson \"jack\" said reese \"we got to do something about this\" robinson soon was kneeling in the on-deck circle as the next dodger batter with him was charlie digiovanna the teams\\' adult batboy who was a confidant of the players \"let somebody else do it jack\" digiovanna implored \"everytime something comes up they call on you\" robinson agreed but once in the batter box he changed his mind hoping to draw maglie toward the first-base line robinson bunted the ball was fielded by whitey lockman the first baseman but maglie didn\\'t move off the ground davey williams the second baseman covered the base for lockman throw knocked over williams \"maglie wouldn\\'t cover\" robinson recalled \"williams got in the way he had a chance to get out of the way but he just stood there right on the base it was just too bad but i knocked him over he had a giant uniform on that what happens\" in the collision williams suffered a spinal injury that virtually ended his career two innings later alvin dark the giants\\' captain and shortstop retaliated by trying to stretch a double into a third-base collision with robinson realizing that dark hoped to avenge the williams incident robinson stepped aside and tagged him in the face but his grip on the ball wasn\\'t secure the ball bounced away dark was safe \"i would\\'ve torn his face up\" robinson once recalled \"but as it turned out i\\'m glad it didn\\'t happen that way i admired al for what he did after i had run down williams i\\'ve always admired al despite his racial stands i think he really believed that white people were put on this earth to take care of black people\" ironically after the 1956 season robinson was traded to the rival giants but he announced his retirement in look magazine any chance of his changing his mind ended when emil buzzy bavasi then a dodger vice president implied that after robinson had been paid for the by-line article he would accept the giants\\' offer succession of executive posts \"after buzzy said that\" robinson later acknowledged \"there was no way i\\'d ever play again\" he joined chock full o\\'nuts the lunch-counter chain as an executive he later had a succession of executive posts with an insurance firm a food-franchising rim and an interracial construction firm he also was chairman of the board of the freedom national bank in harlem and a member of the new york state athletic commission in politics mr robinson remained outspoken he supported richard m nixon in the 1960 presidential election when mr nixon and spiro t agnew formed the 1968 presidential ticket however he resigned from governor rockefeller staff where he was a special assistant for community affairs to campaign for hubert h humphrey the democratic nominee mr robinson described mr nixon stand on civil rights in 1960 as \"forthright\" but denounced the nixon-agnew ticket as \"racist\" mr robinson niche in american history is secure--his struggle predated the emergence of \"the first black who\" in many areas of the american society even though he understandably needed a branch rickey to open the door for him branch rickey needed a jackie robinson to lead other blacks through that door in addition to his wife a fellow-student at ucla whom he married in 1946 mr robinson leaves a son david; a daughter mrs sharon mitchell of washington; a sister mrs willie mae walker and two brothers mack and edgar all of pasadena calif a funeral service will be held friday at noon at the riverside church riverside

       " 'in paris at 10:22 pm on may 21 1927 charles augustus lindbergh a one-time central minnesota farm boy became an international celebrity a fame enveloped the 25-year-old american that was to last him for the remainder of his life transforming him in a frenzied instant from an obscure aviator into a historical figure the consequences of this fame were to exhilarate him to involve him in profound grief to engage him in fierce controversy to turn him into an embittered fugitive from the public to accentuate his individualism to the point where he became a loner to give him a special sense of his own importance to allow him to play an enormous role in the growth of commercial aviation as well as to be a figure in missile and space technology to give him influence in military affairs and to raise a significant voice for conservation a concern that marked his older years all these things were touched off when a former stunt flier and airmail pilot touched down the wheels of his small and delicate monoplane the spirit of st louis on the tarmac of lebourget 33 1/2 hours after having lifted the craft off roosevelt field on long island thousands--no one knows how many--trampled through fences and over guards to surround the silvery plane and to acclaim in a wild outburst of emotion the first man to fly the atlantic solo nonstop from the united states to europe--a feat that was equivalent in the public mind then to the first human step on the moon 42 years later icarus had at last succeeded a daring man alone had attained the unattainable what enhanced the fear for many was that lindbergh was a tall handsome bachelor with a becoming smile an errant lock of blond hair over his forehead and a pleasing outward modesty and guilelessness he was the flawless el cid the gleaming galahad frank merriwell in the flesh the delirium that engulfed paris swirled out over the civilized world banner headlines heralded the event medals galore were bestowed on lindbergh he was gushed over adulated worshiped feted in france belgium and britain president calvin coolidge sent the cruiser memphis flagship of the united states european fleet to bring him and the spirit of st louis back to the united states and later awarded him the medal of honor previously reserved only for military heroes and already a captain in the united states officers reserve corps lindbergh was jumped to a full colonel as the cruiser steamed up chesapeake bay she was met by four destroyers two army blimps and 40 airplanes from the army navy and marine corps debarking at washington in a civilian blue serge suit lindbergh was glorified by the president who said that the trans- atlantic flight was \"the same story of valor and victory by a son of the people that shines through every page of american history\" the panoplied washington reception which was topped by an award--the first in the nation history--of the distinguished flying cross was followed by an even noisier outpouring in new york where four million people spilled into the streets ticker tape and confetti rained on the broadway parade and the day was climaxed by a banquet for 4000 guest \"we measure heroes as we do ships by their displacement\" the bewhiskered charles evans hughes told the multitude \"colonel lindbergh has displaced everything\" and then there were triumphal parades and receptions seemingly endless in other cities lindbergh eventually flew the spirit of st louis to every state in the union everywhere he went a throng collected even a supposedly private visit to orville wright co-inventor of the airplane was noised about and crowds appeared lindbergh at one point was \"so filled up with listening to this hero guff that i was ready to shout murder\" what the parades the pandemonium the oratory the hero worship obscured was that lindbergh epic flight was a most minutely planned venture by a professional flier with 2000 air hours amassed over five years \"why shouldn\\'t i fly from new york to paris\" he had asked himself in september 1926 \"i have more than four years of aviation behind me i\\'ve barnstormed over half of the 48 states i\\'ve flown my mail through the worst of nights\" there had been two previous atlantic flights--both in 1919 the first when one of three navy craft flew from newfoundland to the azores; and the second when john alcock and arthur brown made it from newfoundland to ireland but no one had made the crossing alone or from continent to continent once he conceived the notion of the flight lindbergh with characteristic energy began to elaborate the details he helped design the plane to his specifications calculating every ounce that went into it he laid out his route every foreseeable circumstance was checked out two elements could not be figured: the weather and his ability to stay awake with the weather he took a calculated risk fighting off sleep proved a problem and only his indomitable determination overcame that although he conceded there were moments of touch-and-go one of the attractions for the paris flight was a $25000 prize for which there were several competitors among them clarence chamberlin and adm richard e byrd lindbergh though was confident he could be first and be successful he was motivated he told this writer in later years by a desire to improve his standing as a pilot as well as by an eagerness to win the prize and although there was great interest in him before take-off time his hope and that of his rivals to fly the atlantic had excited wide newspaper coverage lindbergh had not calculated the response to his achievement the degree to which he would be lionized or the extent to which he would be regarded as public property especially by reporters and photographers whom he came quickly to detest \\'extraordinary situation\\' \"the situation i encountered was extraordinary in the extreme and often fantastic\" he recalled and cited as an example a woman who \"wanted to rent the hotel room i was leaving so she could take a bath in the same tub\" overwhelmed without precedents to guide him pressed by dizzying demands on his time lindbergh was happy to accept an invitation from harry guggenheim a very rich and very conservative financier who was connected with the daniel guggenheim fund for the promotion of aeronautics to escape for a while to his long island estate the invitation was at the suggestion of dwight morrow the morgan banker who told mr guggenheim \"harry almost everyone in the country is after this young fellow trying to exploit him isn\\'t there something you and the fund can do to save him from the wolves\" at falaise the guggenheim castle which was perhaps the most opulent private home he had stayed in the aviator was able to catch his breath for three weeks and rewrite the ghostwritten manuscript that became the book \"we\" he also retained henry breckinridge a conservative wall street lawyer to help handle his affairs many of his new associates held conservative views which his father a neo-populist republican spent 20 years fighting lindbergh was not conceived of then as a possible political figure but rather as a nice young man perhaps a little unpolished socially who deserved the best that could be provided his new friends were considerate of his strong individualism they did not impose flattery they were respectful and above all helpful the income from \"we\" and from his flight articles in the new york times made him a millionaire--a considerable eminence for a man accustomed to thinking hard before he spent $5 his friends helped him invest his fortune and after lindbergh made his goodwill flights around the country and to latin america in the spirit of st louis his friends saw to it that he got a job in keeping with his interest in aviation and his status the position was as an adviser in both pan american world airways and the predecessor of trans world airlines in laying out transatlantic transcontinental and caribbean air routes for the commercial aviation that his paris flight had done so much to popularize the conservative views that lindbergh later articulated the remarks about jews that proved so startling when he was opposing american entry into world war ii his adverse opinion of the soviet union his belief in western civilization--these were all a reflection of a world view prevalent among his friends which he absorbed over the years an engineer and aviator of genius he was however not an intellectual nor a consistent reader nor a social analyst the assumption of this elitism accounted for his conviction that \"america should lead the world in the development of flight\" that \"a conflict between english and german groups of nations would [be] a fratricidal war\" that race was a valid judgmental concept and that to accomplish an objective one should deal with \"the top people\" it also accounted for what many people thought was his anti-semitism lindbergh did not regard himself as an anti-semite indeed he was shocked a couple of years ago when this writer put the question to him \"good god no\" he responded citing his fondness for jews he had known or dealt with nor did he condone the nazi treatment of german jews much less hitler genocidal policies on the other hand he accepted as fact that american jewish groups were among those promoting united states involvement in world war ii he voiced these views in a speech in des moines iowa on sept 11 1941 after asserting that those groups responsible for seeking american \"entanglement in european affairs\" were \"the british the jewish and the roosevelt administration\" he went on to say: \"it is not difficult to understand why jewish people desire the overthrow of nazi germany the persecution they suffered in germany would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race no person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution the jewish race suffered in germany \"but no person of honesty and vision can look on their prowar policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy both for us and for them \"instead of agitating for war the jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way for they will be among the first to feel its consequences tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength a few far-sighted jewish people realize this and stand opposed to intervention but the majority still do not their greatest danger to their country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures our press our radio and our government\" the speech evoked a nationwide outcry lindbergh it was said had not only impugned the patriotism of american jews but also had used the word \"race\" a word many jews considered both pejorative and inaccurate lindbergh never withdrew his remarks which he considered statements of \"obvious fact\" \"the violence of the reaction to my naming these groups was significant and extremely interesting\" he said 25 years later \"in hindsight i would not change my action\" lindbergh attitude toward the jews was matched by an adamantine stubbornness on other matters these together sometimes cast him in an unfavorable public light one example of his unwillingness to concede that he might have acted unwisely involved the service cross of the german eagle a civilian medal that was awarded him in 1938 by hermann goering the nazi leader \"at the direction\" of hitler the presentation a surprise to lindbergh was made at a stag dinner in the home of the american ambassador to berlin and was he was told in recognition of his services to aviation especially his 1927 flight the award was reported briefly in the newspapers and stirred little criticism however the night of the award mrs lindbergh told her husband that it was \"the albatross\" and she urged him to return it lindbergh took the position then and later that to do so would affront the ambassador and goering as well who was technically his host in germany although he never wore the medal he gave it to the lindbergh collection of the missouri historical society in st louis along with other awards and trophies it became an issue when he opposed american war involvement it led among other things to his being called a fascist sympathizer particularly when he declined a suggestion in 1942 to repudiate it; and the medal plagued his reputation for the rest of his life he disdained the criticism however saying: \"personally i am not at all concerned about any damage that may have been done to my reputation by the presentation of the medal \"i felt the throwing back of the medal was like taking part in a child spitting contest if i must fight i\\'ll fight; but i prefer not to spit at my enemy beforehand also i felt goering had given me the medal with good intent and in friendship regardless of how much i disagreed with him about other things or later on i did not want to throw it back in his face\" nonetheless lindbergh in his later years was defensive in reciting the medal episode and sensitive in having it known that his wife was among his critics like most people lindbergh was a bundle of unresolved contradictions stubborn proud unable to see how jews might be offended by \"obvious facts\" blind to the villainies of hitlerism he was in his relationships with his few close friends a considerate delightful sensitive helpful unpretentious person who did not obtrude his social and political views nor make agreeing with them a condition of steadfast friendship although he was the object of much flattery and one who succumbed to some of it he did not like a fuss made over him he sometimes sounded pompous in print but he was not in person indeed he was a man of genuinely simple tastes who was happier in a sleeping bag than in a luxury hotel who preferred eating wild boar with his fingers in the jungle to dining in expensive restaurants who found more inner satisfaction with primitive than with sophisticated people and who was more at ease in knockabout attire than in street dress lindbergh life like his personality was full of shadows and enigmas born feb 4 1902 in detroit he was the son of c a lindbergh a prosperous little falls minn lawyer and land speculator and his second wife evangeline lodge land the elder lindbergh first wife had died leaving him two daughters charles augustus lindbergh jr was born in detroit because his mother uncle was a physician there he was returned to little falls six weeks later and lived in that small town the center of a farming and timbering community with few interruptions until he was 18 his paternal antecedents were swedes who changed their name from mansons to lindbergh when they emigrated from sweden in 1860 they had a history of independence and vigor the lands of irish and english background arrived in the united states shortly after 1812 lindbergh maternal grandfather was c h land a dentist and inventor both dr land and c a lindbergh were strong advocates of free inquiry and individual initiative and both impressed on young charles the merits of personal independence lindbergh youth was spent close to nature his deep feeling for it was encouraged by his father and these early attitudes surfaced toward the end of his life when he devoted much of his fantastic energies to the cause of conservation also early in life he showed a marked aptitude for mechanical contrivances when he was 8 or 9 he worked out an ingenious and complicated system for getting ice from the icehouse into the icebox charles world was jolted when his father was elected to the house of representatives where he served from 1907 to 1917 he went to washington his first venture into a metropolis and disliked it about that time his mother and father ceased living together although for appearance sake there was no legal separation and both parents took care to give the child a sense of security apart from saying that the separation was \"a tragic situation\" for his parents lindbergh shut his lips about the situation and shied from talking about the psychic hurts that he bore he was equally taciturn on other personal matters the future aviator interest in flying was sparked in 1908 or \\'09 when one day he heard a buzzing in the sky and climbed out of a dormer window onto the roof of his home to witness a frail biplane skimming through the clouds the fun of flying \"afterward i remember lying in the grass and looking up at the clouds and thinking how much fun it would be to fly up there among those clouds\" he recalled in later years adding: \"i didn\\'t think of the hazards--i was just interested in getting up there in the clouds\" but he was torn for a time by a strong yearning to go to alaska a land pictured as wild frontier and the source of mythic gold rush tales for him alaska was also the scene of robert w service verse some of which he memorized so thoroughly that he could recite it faultlessly in old age although lindbergh sr led an active and exciting political life as a maverick republican who battled and helped to overthrow the entrenched establishment in the house led an assault on \"the money trust\" and voted against american entry into world war i his son was bored by politics and all the speeches the issue that his father espoused in congress and later as a farmer-laborite supporter of robert lafollette failed so the son said to make any impressions on him his mother too eschewed political thinking in world war i lindbergh operated the family farm leaving it in the fall of 1920 to study engineering at the university of wisconsin his grades were poor and he left after a year and a half but not before learning how to shoot quarters out of the outstretched fingers of his friend at 50 feet with a rifle from wisconsin he motorcycled to the nebraska aircraft corporation in lincoln which was then producing an airplane and giving flying lessons to promote the product \"i can still smell the odor of dope [cellulose acetate or nitrate] that permeated each breath\" he said years later in recalling his first close-up view of an aircraft lindbergh took his first flight april 9 1922 in succeeding months he learned to fly to wing- walk and to parachute of equal importance he absorbed all there was to know about the planes of that day and the various styles of flying and he made friends with fliers who passed through lincoln and with harlan a bud gurney with whom among others he barnstormed over the midwest called slim by his friends because of his lithe gangling body and 6-foot-2 1/2-inch height lindbergh was billed to the public as \"daredevil lindbergh\" for his stunt feats however he did not solo until april 1923 when he purchased his first plane a jenny in georgia shortly afterward he began to earn his living as a flier by taking up passengers in various towns at $5 a ride it was all seat-of-the-pants flying and lindbergh gloried in it; but he gave it up to enlist in the army in march 1924 so he could attend the army flying school at brooks field san antonio tex for the first time he found some joy in textbooks and classes chief pilot on mail run indeed he was graduated as the top man in his class and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the army air service reserve in march 1925 he was by this time an experienced flier he spent some time as an air circus stunt flier at county fairs and the like before being hired by the robertson aircraft company of st louis as the chief pilot on the mail run to chicago he made the first run in april 1926 it was the only paycheck job in the normal sense of the word that he ever held meantime he had made a further commitment to the military by joining the missouri national guard where he taught other pilots and became a first lieutenant on one of his flights to chicago in september 1926 he was musing about the possibilities of long-distance trips and he \"startled\" himself by thinking \"i could fly nonstop between new york and paris\" in many ways lindbergh life was a series of responses to imperatives when he became convinced that he \"ought\" to do something--he ought to oppose entry into world war ii he ought to speak out for conservation--he reacted with vigor and dispatch and virtually immediately he began to plan the details of the trip--getting financial backing getting a specially designed plane mapping the route seeking to eliminate any chance of failure ultimately he persuaded a group of st louis businessmen to put up $15000 which was one reason why the plane was called the spirit of st louis after many racking incidents the ryan company with lindbergh help designed and built a craft tailored for him and the wright company built an engine of 223 horsepower to accommodate the plane for several years after the paris flight lindbergh lived in the glare of publicity and popping camera flashbulbs the public would not let him alone \"i recall steeping out of a building on wall street and having almost everyone on the street turn and follow me\" he said he was regarded as a sort of oracle and his opinion was solicited on every conceivable subject he was moreover linked falsely in the press with a number of girls his interest however was in anne spencer morrow the beautiful blue-eyed daughter of dwight morrow then ambassador to mexico the couple met in mexico city at christmastime in 1927 when miss morrow then a smith student went there for the holidays they were married in a private ceremony in the morrow home in new jersey on may 27 1929 the marriage was union of opposites sensitive retiring a poet mrs lindbergh wanted nothing so much as a life of peace and quiet seldom coddling her her husband proved hyperactive happy as a nomad who was rarely at home for long periods yet despite some moments of tension the marriage was an enduring and affectionate one for a while mrs lindbergh accompanied her husband on many of his trips--to the caribbean where he was laying out air routes; to europe and to asia he had taught her to fly and she learned to navigate and to operate a morse code radio \"north to the orient\" is her chronicle of one of these flights their first child charles augustus 3d was born june 24 1930 twenty months later when mrs lindbergh was pregnant with her second child the baby was kidnapped from his nursery crib in his parent home in hopewell n j the date was march 1 1932 on may 12 the baby body was found in a shallow grave not far from the house in between there was a bizarre hunt for the child that included payment of a $50000 ransom at a cemetery in the bronx and a cast of characters that ranged from dr john f jafsie condon a school principal to gaston b means a swindler there were false leads and sensations galore through all of which lindbergh bore himself with great public stoicism his private emotions were never disclosed and about the only references that he made in later years to the kidnapping and murder were fleeting mentions of \"that new jersey business\" if public attention glared on lindbergh during the hunt for his son it positively poured down on him with the arrest and trial of bruno richard hauptmann a bronx carpenter in 1934 the trial which lindbergh attended daily was reported with diligence and sensationalism lindbergh received up to 100000 letters a week and the hopewell estate which he had long since left was overrun with curiosity seekers one of whom dug up and lugged off the earth where the baby was found buried a move to england after a six-week trial in which a web of circumstantial evidence was women about hauptmann he was found guilty and executed although there were doubts hauptmann the german-born father of a son about the age of lindbergh son denied he was guilty lindbergh was satisfied that \"hauptmann did the thing\" meantime there were new threats to kidnap lindbergh second son jon and the family was living an abnormal existence lindbergh was telling friends that americans exhibited \"a morbid curiosity over crimes and murder trials\" and lacked \"respect for law or the rights of others\" against this background lindbergh took his family to england to seek a safe secluded residence away from \"the tremendous public hysteria\" that surrounded him in the united states one result of the case was passage of the so-called lindbergh law which made kidnapping a federal crime part of the statute was ruled unconstitutional in 1967 before departing lindbergh completed a scientific project on which he had been working with dedication and enthusiasm since 1930 it was the design and building of a tissue-perfusion apparatus at rockefeller institute now university in new york he was introduced to the project by dr alexis carrel who had won the nobel prize for physiology and medicine in 1912 for development of blood vessel transplant procedures the french-born carrel was interested in the thirties in living organs outside the body and the problem was to devise an instrument to perfuse these organs and keep them alive \"for me\" lindbergh recalled \"that began an association with an extraordinarily great man to me his true greatness lay in the unlimited penetration curiosity and scope of his mind in his fearlessness of opinion in his deep concerns about the trends of modern civilization and their effect on his fellow man\" in addition to perfecting a pump--an important breakthrough in its time--lindbergh invented a quick way of separating serum from whole blood by means of a centrifuge the lindbergh- carrel friendship lasted for 14 years until the scientist death in 1944 a brilliant investigator carrel tinkered with philosophy and other matters; and his thoughts in these areas were sometimes quirky he believed for example in extrasensory perception he also spoke against \"industrial civilization\" and suggested that \"we ought to try to produce a certain number of individuals above the mental stature we observe in the best\" he said moreover that \"only the elite make the progress of the masses possible\" some of these notions rubbed off on lindbergh and were reflected in his little-known book \"of flight and life\" in which he inveighed against \"scientific materialism\" in this 1948 book he said \"i believe the values we are creating and the standards we are now following will lead to the end of our civilization and that if we do not control our science by a higher moral force it will destroy us with its materialistic values\" in his plea for the recognition of metaphysical values lindbergh wrote: \"to progress even to survive we must learn to apply the truth of god to the actions and relationships of men to the direction of our science we must learn from the sermons of christ the wisdom of laotzu the teachings of buddha\" but lindbergh in this book also espoused a doctrine of american superiority in the world \"for americans the doctrine of universal equality is a doctrine of death\" he wrote \"if we ever become an equal people among other peoples of the world our civilization will fall\" when lindbergh went abroad to live first in britain and then in france he was 33 years old he was immediately treated with courtesy and respect--and given the privacy he so much desired his new friends were in the upper reaches of british society and tory politics moreover as a distinguished aviator he was invited to visit airplane factories in france by the french air ministry he was also invited by the german government to inspect the luftwaffe and warplane factories in the reich he received red-carpet treatment visited many factories and was told repeatedly that the nazis were eager \"to create an air force second to none\" he visited germany several times before 1938 and was increasingly impressed with the quality of the air force it seemed to him all the more fearsome by comparison with the air arm in britain france and the soviet union by 1939 he had concluded that the power of the luftwaffe was overwhelming and that the air forces of other european countries were comparatively insignificant in off-the- record conversations with the leaders of these countries the soviet union excepted he sought to warn them of the perils they were facing neither then nor later did lindbergh according to his journals believe that german air power would be the decisive factor in a war so much as it would be an essential element and he sought to impress on france britain and the united states the need to bestir themselves lindbergh and his family returned to the united states in 1939 shortly before world war ii broke out he felt he ought to do all he could to prevent american involvement not a pacifist nor an isolationist he was a noninterventionist \"my opposition to world war ii resulted from the growing conviction that such a war would probably devastate europe kill millions of men and possibly result in the end of western civilization\" he told this writer a few years ago adding: \"under the circumstances of prewar europe i concluded that germany could not be defeated without the active intervention of the united states i doubted that germany could be defeated even with american intervention \"obviously this depended a great deal on the relationship between germany and russia but if germany were defeated it seemed to me almost certain that russia would be the real victor and that a stalin-dominated europe would be even worse than a hitler-dominated europe \"i felt that the wisest policy for western powers would be to arm stay neutral and let germany and russia clash--and thereafter to feel their way according to changing circumstances i still think this would have been the wisest policy\" lindbergh made his first antiwar speech--a radio talk--on sept 17 1939 it was arranged by fulton lewis a well-known conservative commentator in the months that followed he made other radio speeches and worded actively with other antiwar personalities in public and private life including senator burton k wheeler of montana; senator harry f byrd of virginia; former president herbert hoover; senator william borah of idaho; henry ford; merwin k hart an avowed right-winger; william castle a diplomat; dean carl ackerman of the columbia journalism school; theodore roosevelt jr; and james e van zandt head of the american legion lindbergh spoke and worked under his own auspices until april 1941 when he joined the national board of the america first committee the country principal antiwar group although its membership was heterogeneous its effective leadership rested with robert e wood board chairman of sears roebuck & co and robert r mccormick publisher of the chicago tribune both were archconservatives and zealous haters of president franklin d roosevelt america first was strongest in the midwest the traditional seat of the nation isolationist attitudes; but it was also a powerful force in new york and boston popular support for its antiwar objectives was widespread and lindbergh epitomized that support he rallied millions to the cause with such effectiveness that roosevelt considered him a major threat the president vented his anger at a news conference in april 1941 roosevelt was asked why he did not call lindbergh an army officer into uniform the reason he replied was that lindbergh was a defeatist and he went on to compare him with representative clement l vallandigham a civil war congressman from ohio the chief spokesman of a group called the copperheads who said the north could never win roosevelt attack was perhaps set off by a lindbergh magazine article that declared \"while our leaders have shouted for peace they have consistently directed us toward war\" \\'insult from roosevelt\\' considering his honor impugned lindbergh resigned his commission \"if i did not tender my resignation\" he said in the published version of his \"wartime journals\" \"i would lose something in my own character that means even more to me than my commission in the air corps \"no one else would know it but i would and if i take this insult from roosevelt more and worse will probably be forthcoming\" thirty years later lindbergh still felt wronged by the president and professed not to see that he himself had questioned roosevelt integrity with pearl harbor america first collapsed and lindbergh sought to join the armed forces \"now that we are at war i want to contribute as best i can to my country war effort\" he wrote \"it is vital for us to carry on this was as intelligently as constructively and as successfully as we can and i want to do my part\" his bid to soldier was rebuffed however an action for which he blamed roosevelt personally lindbergh then 39 joined the ford motor company as a consultant working at the willow run plant in michigan which was producing bombers later he was a consultant to the united aircraft corporation attached chiefly to its vought-sikorsky division in stratford conn vought was producing the navy corsair f4u as part of his job he traveled to the pacific war area in 1944 to study the corsair under service conditions and as a civilian flew 50 missions against the japanese the flier had at least one very close brush with death in a dogfight near biak island he described this and other episodes in \"the wartime journals\" and they constitute the best writing in the book after the war lindbergh went to germany for the naval technical mission in europe to study developments in nazi aircraft and missiles he had been interested in rocketry since 1929 when he sought out dr robert goddard then an obscure physics professor at clark university in worcester mass goddard who had been ridiculed for his ideas has since been recognized as a space flight pioneer lindbergh was always proud of his association with goddard and of having raised money to fund his experiments for 16 years until his death in 1945 goddard also a loner received lindbergh help and encouragement; and goddard basic rocketry patents were used in the development of united states missiles after the war the aviator crucial assistance to goddard did not become well known until goddard biography was published in 1963 a book for which lindbergh wrote an introduction for more than 15 years after the war lindbergh virtually disappeared from the news he was a member of army ordnance chore project at the university of chicago; he was consultant to the secretary of the air force; he took part in the reorganization of the strategic air command; and he was a member of scientific ballistic-missile committees of the air force and the defense department in 1954 he was commissioned a brigadier general in the air force reserve much of the aviator work in these years dealt with security-classified projects; but it is believed that he was active in rocketry and space flight programs where his technical expertise was valuable he enjoyed top-secret clearance and spoke of his tasks as having to do with security in this period lindbergh completed his autobiographical account of his 1927 flight which had been written in bits and pieces in various parts of the world over 14 years \"the spirit of st louis\" published in 1953 won the pulitzer prize for biography in 1954 and was made into a movie three years later with james stewart as the lead the book was intended to supersede \"we\" which written in haste had never satisfied the aviator as an accurate account of his flight starting sometime after the war he rejoined pan american as a consultant for the nominal fee of $600 a month the job which eventually led to his working on the design specifications for the boeing 747 allowed him great freedom to travel and to develop any interest he chose and travel he did seemingly having no settled abode in africa in 1964 he found an interest that was to occupy his last years and to bring him out of his public reticence and reclusiveness the issue was conservation \"lying under an acacia tree with the sounds of the dawn around me\" he recalled \"i realized more clearly the facts that man should never overlook: that the construction of an airplane for instance is simple when compared to the evolutionary achievement of a bird; that airplanes depend on an advanced civilization and that where civilization is most advanced few birds exist \"i realized that if i had to choose i would rather have birds than airplanes\" he concluded he said \"that i ought to do something\" concern for environment that imperative which unfolded slowly led him to activity in conservation organizations to having a large hand in saving the humpback and the blue whales to concern for endangered species and to public advocacy of steps to save the world environment he made his first public speech in 1968--the first since 1941--to the alaska legislature the following year he granted what amounted to his first newspaper interview in 35 years this was to the new york times and this writer the occasion being his conservation activity in the philippines there was anther interview in 1970 again in the philippines but centering on his concern for primitive peoples and again in 1971 he took this writer with him on a long american conservation tour which was also a journey backward in time to his boyhood home in minnesota lindbergh said that he had unveiled himself because he thought the cause of conservation so urgent \"i have had enough publicity for 15 lives\" he said \"and i seek no more of it but where i can accomplish a purpose i will do things i otherwise abhor\" there was no doubt that his leadership was effective even though he was talking to a generation born long after his paris flight his person and his name evoked a tangible response he did not pretend to be an expert but had a singular ability to stir response and activity to enunciate general principles and to cheer people on it did not appear to matter that he had published his bulky \"wartime journals\" in 1970 to general critical dispraise what seemed to count was that he was charles augustus lindbergh the hero still of 1927 whose smile was engaging whose words were straightforward whose manner was simple and whose message was forceful this was perhaps the ultimate enigma of his life; for beneath his outer coating was a man who kept more to himself and perhaps to his wife than he ever gave to the public',\n",
       " 'adlai ewing stevenson was a rarity in american public life a cultivated urbane witty articulate politician whose popularity was untarnished by defeat and whose stature grew in diplomacy he graced the presidential campaigns of 1952 and 1956 and his eloquence and his wit won him the devoted admiration of millions of americans in more than four years as the nation chief spokesman at the united nations he gained the same sort of admiration from the world statesmen for his ready tongue his sharp mind and his patience in dealing with the grave issues that confronted the world organization as chief united states delegate with the rank of ambassador mr stevenson was in the thick of debate and negotiations during the bay of pigs and cuban missile crises disarmament talks upheavals in the congo the war in south vietnam and the revolt in santa domingo one of mr stevenson greatest satisfactions was the signing in 1963 of the treaty banning all but underground testing of nuclear devices he was a member of the united states delegation that traveled to moscow to sign the document when he ran for the presidency in 1956 mr stevenson suggested a world agreement to ban the testing of hydrogen bombs it was attacked by the republicans at the time as visionary and it may have hurt his campaign tv would show him intent during council sessions during television coverage of security council debates mr stevenson tanned freckled and balding head was a familiar sight as he sat at the council horseshoe-shaped table he looked intent as he crouched over the table to listen to the remarks of another delegate but he relaxed when it came his turn to speak his words flowed easily and steadily in a voice that for its precision and diction reminded some of ronald colman the movie actor his logic and his words could be coruscating as when he was disputing soviet spokesmen or they could take wings of idealism as when he was expounding the importance of the united nations as the keeper of the world peace however much mr stevenson might berate the soviet union at the council table he refrained from banal personalities the result was that he was on good social terms with the soviet diplomats as he was with those of other countries whose views he found more congenial mr stevenson was appointed to his united nations post in 1961 by president kennedy and reconfirmed in the job by president johnson the appointment came in response not only to mr stevenson deep knowledge of foreign affairs but also to the pressure from influential democrats who had backed mr stevenson for the presidential nomination in 1960 mr stevenson held cabinet rank but there were indications that his role as a policy-maker was limited in the bay of pigs crisis in 1961 he suffered grave embarrassment in security council debates because the white house had not briefed him truthfully on the united states involvement in the invasion of cuba by cuban exiles it was a measure of his popularity in the diplomatic community that he recovered from that incident with little loss of prestige he said un assignment was a \\'terrible drill\\' there was some hint that mr stevenson was less than ecstatic about his united nations responsibilities \"this job has been a terrible drill\" he told martin mayer in an interview earlier this year for an article in the new york times magazine \"in my own life i\\'ve been accustomed to making policy\" he continued \"i\\'ve sometimes been a little restless in this role of executing and articulating the policies of others \"there is a disadvantage in being anywhere other than the seat of power and every issue that comes to the u n has its antecedents before it gets here the state department has been involved in the negotiations and now the situation has become insoluable so it gets dumped onto us\" mr stevenson also expressed the belief that he had become \"an old and familiar face\" at the united nations headquarters building in new york \"you take on the coloration of your country your country face and you become predictable\" he said adding: \"you lose some of the rosy glow you brought with you apart from my taste for creative aspects the time comes when you should bring in a fresh face and a new outlook\" despite these reservations mr stevenson with his hamlet-like ability to state another proposition said that \"it easy to reconcile a sense of duty with this job\" he conceded that his decisions had \"always come about more by circumstances and events than by conscious calculation\" as a diplomat mr stevenson put in punishing hours most days he was on the go from an appointment at 8:15 am to well after midnight after an official working day he would go on the cocktail-party-and-dinner circuit for the rest of the evening--social duties that his post required of him in these he had a truly awesome stamina for he was as eruditely charming late at night as he had been at breakfast a good part of mr stevenson charm rested in his ability to discuss himself without pomposity although he was badly beaten for the presidency by dwight d eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 he was not bitter talking to a group of volunteers after his defeat in 1956 he said: \"to you who are disappointed tonight let me confess that i am too    be of good cheer and remember my dear friends that a wise man said: \\'a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit dryeth the bones\\'\" mr stevenson although he dressed well was not happy as a fashion plate as governor of illinois he preferred to work in his office in a brown tweed sports jacket odd trousers and a striped shirt his favorite footgear then was a pair of old golf shoes with the spikes removed his predilection for informal attire was not only a matter of personal comfort but also an expression of the fact that although he was well-to-do he was not a conspicuous spender during his gubernatorial term which began in 1949 he purchased only one new suit a hole in his shoe which was a trademark of his white house campaign in 1952 was another example of his frugality after his defeat in 1956 mr stevenson practiced law and traveled extensively on business visiting more than 30 countries on one trip he spent three weeks in the soviet union and had a long conversation with the then premier nikita s khrushchev although mr stevenson had chided general eisenhower in 1956 as \"a part-time president\" and had been critical of the eisenhower foreign policy the president appointed him consultant to the secretary of state in preparation for a meeting of the north atlantic treaty organization council in paris eggheads\\' idol in 1960 as in 1952 and 1956 in 1960 many liberals and intellectuals in the democratic party urged him to seek the presidential nomination he was then as he had been in 1952 and 1956 the idol of the eggheads men and women who were not ashamed to confess to a college education and to ideas more profound than those ordinarily passed at the bridge table professional politicians however were less enthusiastic because he seemed reluctant to work with them and because they though he talked over the heads of his audiences mr stevenson vacillated and it was not until the last minute that he agreed to let his name be placed before the convention by then it was too late he got the applause of the gallery while mr kennedy reaped the delegates\\' votes some of mr stevenson ambivalence toward politics sprang from a feeling that glad-handing was a species of hokum he expressed this sentiment to an old friend after one hard day of handshaking in the 1952 campaign in these words: \"perhaps the saddest part of all this is that a candidate must reach into a sea of hands grasp one not knowing whose it is and say \\'i\\'m glad to meet you\\' realizing that he hasn\\'t and probably never will meet that man\" when he went into the 1952 campaign mr stevenson was virtually unknown nationally but in the election he polled more than 27 million votes a surprising figure however this won him only 89 electoral votes as general eisenhower swamped him with nearly 34 million popular votes and 442 in the electoral college the democratic candidate emerged from the campaign with the grudging respect of many republicans for the quality of his speeches--he wrote most of them himself--and for his good manners for all his politeness and his patrician birth and education mr stevenson became after 1952 one of the hardest-hitting adversaries of the late senator joseph r mccarthy republican of wisconsin a notable exponent of jugular-vein politics moreover mr stevenson turned into an articulate spokesman for internationalism and an active titular leader of his party to the shallowness of practical politics he added a philosophy of liberalism that was almost jeffersonian in its literate defense of the rights of the individual its educated revulsion against mob-inflaming demagoguery \"when demagoguery and deceit become a national political movement\" he asserted \"we americans are in trouble; not just democrats but all of us\" genial with a touch of shyness this product of princeton harvard and northwestern university seemed so out of place in practical politics that a more seasoned politician tutoring him for active campaigning recalled \"godawmighty we almost had to tear off the starched dickeys and the homburg hat he used to wear\" trained to the law and diplomacy he was a realist at dealing with essential political compromise but when moved deeply by principle he risked political sabotage and personal obloquy for his convictions thus during 1952 when he was asked why in 1949 he had signed an affidavit speaking well of the reputation of alger hiss later convicted of perjury mr stevenson replied: \"i am a lawyer i think that one of the most fundamental responsibilities not only of every citizen but particularly of lawyers is to give testimony in a court of law to give it honestly and willingly and it will be a very unhappy day for anglo-saxon justice when a man even a man in public life is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might be convicted that would to me be the ultimate timidity\" on july 25 1952 what was described as the first \"open\" democratic national convention in 20 years nominated mr stevenson as its presidential candidate and senator john j sparkman of alabama as his running mate they opposed general eisenhower and the then senator richard m nixon of california mr stevenson then governor of illinois had insisted repeatedly that he would \"rather not\" be president he was quoted as having said that he was not fitted mentally temperamentally or physically for the office the stevenson boom began in the spring of 1952 after he had visited president truman in washington but keeping outwardly aloof from the scramble for convention delegates he refused to identify himself as a candidate down to the moment the voting began in his acceptance speech to the convention the candidate told the cheering delegates: \"sacrifice patience understanding and implacable purpose may be our lot for years to come let face it let talk sense to the american people\" his candor cost him many votes on the question of who should receive the benefit of royalties from offshore oil deposits he took his stand with president truman that the federal government had \"paramount rights\" in the deposits this cost him much support in texas florida and virginia he refused to take a stand in favor of continuing discrimination against negro citizens which antagonized \"white supremacy\" elements in the democratic party in the south at the same time his firm belief in states\\' rights and responsibilities cost him some negro votes among other issues that influenced the vote substantially were corruption in washington communist infiltration the korean war high taxes and the high cost of living fear of inflation and the growth of federal centralism these were pressed by republican campaigners but the greatest obstacle to mr stevenson success was the popularity of his opponent analyses of the vote indicated that although labor had gone solidly for mr stevenson and although he had retained much of the farm vote he had lost the support of women voters and particularly the so-called independent voters of both sexes but the strength of mr stevenson candidacy was shown in the fact that under circumstances that should have produced an overwhelming republican landslide--a popular candidate popular issues and an incumbent administration whose party had been in power for 20 years--the democratic candidate rolled up 3000000 more votes than were received by president truman in 1948 in his victory over thomas e dewey with the 1952 election over mr stevenson took the role of opposition leader although he admitted that he envied one man--the governor of illinois his first speech and a four-day visit to washington rallied nearly all democrats to his side he received such an admiring welcome from the jubilant republicans at the capital that political opponents jested that he could not have been feted more if his candidacy had been successful part of the tribute arose because he took immediate steps to heal the wounds of the bitter phases of the campaign and did what he could to rally his fellow democrats behind the incoming president during the visit mr stevenson met with democratic leaders and mapped plans to unite the party in opposition he also conferred with leaders of the republican administration about his plans for a nonpolitical world tour covering particularly the far east on the five-month tour he talked with leading figures and studied conditions in korea malay burma india and the then indochina as well as in various european countries he said the real purpose of his tour had been self-education mr stevenson underwent a kidney stone operation in chicago in april 1954 a month later it was reported that he had completely recovered taking a vigorous part in the bitter congressional election campaign of 1954 he hammered in his speeches at the three principal issues of foreign policy domestic economy and internal security this confirmed him as his party chief national spokesman the democratic victory in the elections made him the leading contender for the 1956 presidential nomination he said republican party was \\'half mccarthy\\' his attacks on the republicans concentrated on the influence of senator mccarthy the republican party he charged had become \"half mccarthy and half eisenhower\" and vice president nixon the principal republican campaigner he accused of preaching \"mccarthyism in a white collar\" mr nixon declared that mr stevenson had \"not changed since he testified for alger hiss\" and he accused mr stevenson of unconsciously having spread communist propaganda after the election of 1954 mr stevenson announced that he was returning to the private practice of law in chicago \"i have done what i could for the democratic party for the past two years\" he said \"and now i shall have to be less active and give more attention to my own affairs\" mr stevenson was admitted to practice before the united states supreme court and was engaged by the radio corporation of america to defend it in a $16000000 antitrust suit he lost the first two legal skirmishes of the case he still kept in touch with political and foreign affairs however in april 1955 after a long democratic silence he made a national radio address opposing the defense of the chinese nationalist islands of quemoy and matsu he also called for a joint declaration by the united states and its allies pledging united defense of taiwan pending its final disposition although mr stevenson repeatedly refused to say whether he would be a candidate for the presidential nomination in 1956 he had won the support of the party most influential leaders however many in the south who had opposed him in 1952 still did so in sharp contrast with his preconvention attitude of indifference toward the 1952 nomination mr stevenson quickly jumped into the fight for the 1956 nomination he formally announced his candidacy on nov 15 1955 moderation was the keynote of his campaign particularly with respect to enforcement of the supreme court decision abolishing racial segregation in public schools but generally with respect to all issues foreign and domestic mr stevenson took an early lead in the race for the nomination the support of political organizations in large-population states gave him an imposing list of delegate strength however he suffered setbacks in early 1956 states primaries where senator estes kefauver of tennessee showed surprising popular support these reverses stimulated mr stevenson to more aggressive tactics instead of holding aloof from the crowds he began to make hand-shaking tours asking the voters for support as the primaries continued he began to fare better and by may the political observers seemed to agree that he had reversed the tide which then appeared to be running in his direction mr stevenson campaign managers from the beginning claimed victory for him they asserted that more delegates had been pledged to him than the majority necessary to nominate at the democratic national convention in 1952 mr stevenson had surrounded himself largely with \"amateurs\" but in the 1956 campaign he put more emphasis on practical politics in choosing top aides at his chicago campaign headquarters he pitched his early campaign speeches to a vigorous attack on president eisenhower foreign policy whenever possible he ignored his democratic opponents for the nomination and sought to draw the issue from the beginning as stevenson versus eisenhower in the election he was defeated by a greater margin than in 1952 polling 26 million popular votes to more than 355 million by president eisenhower the electoral college figures were 73 to 457 his father was executive of hearst enterprises mr stevenson was born on feb 5 1900 in los angeles where his father lewis green stevenson was at the time an executive of hearst newspapers mining and ranching properties his family roots went back to the pre-revolutionary war period he was a grandson and namesake of a vice president of the united states--the adlai stevenson who held the office in the second term of grover cleveland administration through his mother he was a fifth-generation illinoisan a grandson of jesse fell who was the first to propose abraham lincoln for the presidency when adlai was 6 years old the family moved back to their home town of bloomington ill where mrs stevenson family owned the daily pantagraph adlai father later became state secretary for illinois and from 1914 to 1917 served as chairman of the state board of pardons mr stevenson went to the choate preparatory school wallingford conn and princeton university from which he was graduated in 1922 he was managing editor of the daily princetonian after leaving princeton mr stevenson went to harvard law school for two years he got passing marks but was disinterested in his studies a legal case that evolved from the death of an uncle redistributed shares in the pantagraph between members of the family as a result mr stevenson and his cousin davis c merwin decided they would learn the newspaper business mr stevenson spent a couple of years on the paper in various editorial posts but by the time the courts had ruled that the stevenson and merwin families should have equal shares of ownership his interest in becoming a newspaper editor had waned he decided to finish his law course and having fallen a year behind his classmates who already had been graduated from harvard he entered the law school of northwestern university he received his law degree in 1926 soon after his graduation he settled in chicago to practice law in december 1928 mr stevenson married ellen borden of chicago her father a socialite and financier who made the first of several fortunes as a colleague of john hertz in the yellow cab company later became active in mining in st louis the stevensons were divorced in 1949 his wife was said to abhor politics and to have wished to devote herself to the world of art and literature no other person and no scandal were involved in the legal proceedings held in las vegas nev the couple had three sons adlai ewing iii borden and john fell soon after the 1952 presidential boom started for mr stevenson he was approached by a would- be biographer the man told the governor he was going to write a book about him \"i don\\'t see how you are going to do it\" mr stevenson said \"my life has been hopelessly undramatic i wasn\\'t born in a log cabin i didn\\'t work my way through school nor did i rise from rags to riches and there no use trying to pretend i did i\\'m not a wilkie and i don\\'t claim to be a simple barefoot la salle street lawyer you might be able to write about some of my ancestors they accomplished quite a lot at one time or another but you can\\'t do anything much about me at least i\\'d hate to have to try it\" mr stevenson had laid the groundwork for his political career by public service that began in 1933 when he first went to washington as one of the many bright young lawyers president franklin d roosevelt had summoned to help formulate the new deal for two years mr stevenson was special counsel to the agricultural adjustment administration touring the country holding hearings and advising regional groups of farmers ranchers orchardists and dairymen how to utilize the measure and then returning to washington to try to work out marketing agreements at the end of the two years he went back to private law practice in chicago he served as president for one term of the chicago council on foreign relations--a post in which he got considerable experience as an after-dinner speaker--and he also became chicago chairman of the william allen white committee to defend america by aiding the allies mr stevenson brought people like wendell willkie carl sandburg and dorothy thompson to address meetings one of which in 1941 filled the chicago stadium in the summer of that year the late frank knox then secretary of the navy and a close friend of mr stevenson telephoned mr stevenson later quoted mr knox as saying \"everyone else around washington has a lawyer and i guess i ought to have one too\" he was in washington within a few days starting to prepare legal machinery whereby the navy in case it became necessary could take over the strike-bound kearny shipyards in new jersey then building essential warships he continued to do similar legal work for the navy department until 1943 when he led a mission to italy to plan occupation policies later he served as an assistant to secretaries of state edward stettinius and james byrnes he also was a representative to the san francisco united nations conference and then was an aide to the united states delegation in the united nations general assembly at the meeting of the general assembly held in london in january 1946 mr stevenson was senior adviser to the american delegation he resigned after the session ended in march but president truman appointed him alternate delegate to the second session that fall mr stevenson returned to chicago in 1947 his friends backed him as a \"clean-up\" candidate against the republican administration of gov dwight w green winning the backing of jacob m arvey chairman of the cook county democratic committee mr stevenson was nominated for governor paul douglas then professor of economics at chicago university was named for senator the democratic \"clean-up\" team swept into office mr stevenson defeating mr green by 572000 votes while president truman was nosing out thomas e dewey in illinois by a mere 34000 the self-styled \"amateur\" in politics consecrated his government in an inaugural address to \"plain talk hard work and prairie horse sense\" drive on gambling listed among acts as governor during his term in office mr stevenson was credited with the following accomplishments: an attendant at the birth of the new deal mr stevenson supported mr truman successor fair deal but his differences with the administration on some phases of domestic policy were implicit in his own record in illinois the variance was evident in his stand on the cost of government taxation and negligence toward official irregularities and corruption \"i think government should be as small in scope and as local in character as possible\" he said on one occasion mr stevenson was the author of seven books: \"major campaign speeches 1952\" \"call to greatness\" \"what i think\" \"the new america\" \"friends and enemies\" \"putting first things first\" and \"looking outward\"',\n",
       " 'probably nowhere in all the imaginative field of fiction could one find a career more dramatic and bizarre than that portrayed in real life by george herman ruth known the world over even in foreign lands where baseball is never played as the babe he was the boy who rose from the obscurity of a charitable institution in baltimore to a position as the leading figure in professional baseball he was also its greatest drawing-card its highest salaried performer--at least of his day--and the idol of millions of youngsters throughout the land a creation of the times he seemed to embody all the qualities that a sport-loving nation demanded of its outstanding hero for it has always been debatable whether ruth owed his fame and the vast fortune it made for him more to his ability to smash home runs in greater quantity than any other player in the history of the game or to a strange personality that at all times was intensely real and \"regular\" which was the one fixed code by which he lived he made friends by the thousands and rarely if ever lost any of them affable boisterous and good-natured to a fault he was always as accessible to the newsboy on the corner as to the most dignified personage in worldly affairs more he could be very much at each with both he could scarcely recall a name even of certain intimates with whom he frequently came in contact but this at no time interfered with the sincerity of his greeting indeed by a singular display of craft he overcame this slight deficiency with consummate skill if you looked under 40 it was \"hello kid how are you\" and if you appeared above that line of demarcation it was \"hello doc how everything going\" how ruth aided small boy the story is told of the case of johnny sylvester a youngster whose life doctors had despaired of unless something unusual happened to shock him out of a peculiar malady the boy uncle recalling how fond he always had been of baseball conceived the idea of sending word to babe ruth and asking his aid the next day the babe armed with bat glove and half a dozen signed baseballs made one of his frequent pilgrimages to a hospital the boy unexpectedly meeting his idol face to face was so overjoyed that he was cured--almost miraculously a year later an elderly man accosted the babe in a hotel lobby and after receiving the customary whole-hearted greeting of \"hello doc\" said: \"babe i don\\'t know whether you remember me but i\\'m johnny sylvester uncle and i want to tell you the family will never forget what you did for us johnny is getting along fine\" \"that great\" replied the babe \"sure i remember you glad to hear johnny is doing so well bring him around some time\" after a few more words they parted and no sooner had the man removed himself from earshot than the babe turned to a baseball writer at his elbow and asked: \"now who the devil was johnny sylvester\" never lost carefree spirit nor must this be mistaken for affectation for there was never a doubt that the babe at all times was tremendously sincere in his desire to appear on friendly terms with all the world and though in later years he acquired a certain polish which he lacked utterly in his early career he never lost his natural self nor his flamboyant carefree mannerisms which at all times made him a show apart from the ball field single-handed he tore the final game of the 1928 world series in st louis to shreds with his mighty bat by hitting three home runs over the right-field pavilion that night returning to new york he went on a boisterous rampage and no one on the train got any sleep including his employer the late colonel jacob ruppert such was the blending of qualities that made babe ruth a figure unprecedented in american life a born showman off the field and a marvelous performer on it he had an amazing flair for doing the spectacular at the most dramatic moment of his early days in baltimore even babe himself was or pretended to be somewhat vague during his major league baseball career thus various versions of his childhood were printed over the years with neither denial nor confirmation from ruth as to their accuracy however the following account of his boyhood years appeared in a national magazine under ruth own \"by-line:\" \"in the first place i was not an orphan * * * my mother whose maiden name was schanberg lived until i was 13 my father george herman ruth lived until my second year in the majors few fathers ever looked more like their sons than my pop and i my mother was mainly irish and was called kate my father was of german extraction it is not true that our family name was erhardt as has been repeatedly written or ehrhardt or gearhardt \"but i hardly knew my parents i don\\'t want to make any excuses for or place the blame for my shortcomings as a kid completely on persons or places * * * yet i probably was a victim of circumstances i spent most the first seven years of my life living over my father saloon at 426 west camden street baltimore * * * \"on june 13 1902 when i was 7 years old my father and mother placed me in st mary industrial school in baltimore it has since been called an orphanage and a reform school it was in fact a training school for orphans incorrigibles delinquents boys whose homes had been broken by divorce runaways picked up on the streets of baltimore and children of poor parents who had no other means of providing an education for them \"i was listed as an incorrigible and i guess i was * * * i chewed tobacco when i was 7 not that i enjoyed it especially but from my observation around the saloon it seemed the normal thing to do gaps in school life \"i was released from st mary in july 1902 but my parents returned me there in november of the same year my people moved to a new neighborhood just before christmas 1902 and i was released to them again this time i stayed \\'out\\' until 1904 but then they put me back again and i was not released again until 1908 shortly after my mother died i was returned to st mary once more by my father he took me back home in 1911 and returned me in 1912 i stayed in school--learning to be a tailor and shirtmaker--until feb 27 1914 the last item on my \\'record\\' at st mary was a single sentence written in the flowing hand of one of the teachers it read: \"\\'he is going to join the balt baseball team\\'\" ruth said he played in the band at st mary and always pointed with pride to this accomplishment frequently reminding friends that he also was a musician as well as a ball player curiously enough however no one ever discovered what instrument the babe played although he always stoutly denied that it was the bass drum but baseball captivated his fancy most and now began a train of circumstances that was to carry this black-haired raw-boned youngster to fame and a fortune that has been estimated as close to $1000000 it also happened that brother benedict one of the instructors at st mary was a great lover of the national pastime using baseball therefore as the most plausible means to a laudable end in keeping the babe out of mischief as much as possible the good brother encouraged the youngster to play as much as he could the babe scarcely needed encouragement every hour he was allowed to spare from his classrooms found him on the ball field he batted left-handed and threw left-handed he played on his school team also on a semi- professional team he also played pretty nearly every position on the field at the age of 19 he astounded even his sponsor brother benedict who now saw a real means of livelihood ahead for the young man though little dreaming at the time to what heights he would soar he recommended the babe to his friend the late jack dunn then owner of the baltimore orioles of the international league and ruth received a trial alternating in the outfield and in the pitcher box that was in 1914 the same summer he was sold to the boston red sox for $2900 and after a brief period of farming out with providence was recalled to become a regular under the direction of bill carrigan then manager of the red sox ruth rapidly developed into one of the most talented left-handed pitchers ever in the majors he had tremendous speed and a baffling cross-fire curve which greatly impressed ed barrow later to become associated with colonel ruppert as general manager of the yankees barrow because the leader of the red sox in 1918 and gave much time to ruth development but even then he also displayed unmistakable talent for batting a ball with tremendous power and with unusual frequency and barrow one of baseball greatest men of vision decided to convert ruth permanently into an outfielder on the theory that a great hitter could be built into a greater attraction than a great pitcher it was quite a momentous decision for in the 1918 world series against the cubs ruth had turned in two masterful performances on the mound for the red sox winning both his games he had also turned in one victory for the red sox against brooklyn in the world series of 1916 but barrow had also seen ruth in 1918 hit eleven home runs an astonishing number for that era particularly for a pitcher and his mind was made up the next year--1919--ruth pitching only occasionally now and then helping out at first base but performing mostly in the outfield cracked twenty-nine home runs and the baseball world began to buzz as it hadn\\'t since the advent of ty cobb and the immortal christy mathewson this total surpassed by four the then accepted major league record for home runs in a season set by buck freeman with the washington club in 1899 but it was the following year--1920--that was to mark the turning point not only in babe ruth career but in the entire course of organized baseball indeed baseball men are almost in accord in the belief that babe ruth more than any individual and practically single-handed rescued the game from what threatened to be one of its darkest periods not only rescued it but diverted it into new channels that in the next decade were to reap an unprecedented golden harvest the first sensation came early that winter when ruth was sold by the late harry frazee then owner of the red sox to the yankees owned jointly by the two colonels jacob ruppert and tillinghast l\\'hommedieu huston for a reported price of $125000 it may even have been more for in making the purchase the yankee owners also assumed numerous financial obligations then harassing the boston owner and the matter was very involved but whatever the price it was a record sum and new york prepared to welcome its latest hero prospect the babe did not disappoint the yankees were then playing their home games at the polo grounds home of the giants and before the close of the 1920 season they were already giving their more affluent rivals and landlords a stiff run for the city baseball patronage ruth surpassed all expectations by crashing out the unheard-of total of fifty-four home runs and crowds which hitherto had lavished their attention on the giants now jammed the historic polo grounds to see the marvelous bambino hit a homer crisis in history of game but scarcely had the echoes from the thunderous roars that greeted the ruthian batting feats subsided than another explosion was touched off that rattled the entire structure of baseball down to its sub-cellar the scandal of the world series of 1919 broke into print and through the winter of 1920-21 the \"throwing\" of that series by certain white sox players to the reds was on every tongue the baseball owners of both major leagues were in a panic fearful that the public confidence in what they had so proudly called america national pastime had been shaken beyond repair true they had induced the late kenesaw mountain landis a federal judge to assume the position of high commissioner with unlimited powers to safeguard against a repetition of such a calamity but they feared it was not enough with considerable misgivings they saw the 1921 season get under way and then as the popular song of the day ran \"along came ruth\" inside of a fortnight the fandom of the nation has forgotten all about the black sox as they had come to be called as its attention became centered in an even greater demonstration of superlative batting skill by the amazing babe ruth home runs began to scale off his bat in droves crowds jammed ball parks in every city in which he appeared and when he closed the season with a total of fifty-nine circuit clouts surpassing by five his own record of the year before the baseball world lay at his feet in addition to that the yankees that year captured the first pennant ever won by new york in the american league and ruth was now fairly launched upon the first chapter of the golden harvest with the help of his towering war club the yankees won again in 1922 and repeated in 1923 in addition to winning the world championship that year also in 1923 came into being the \"house that ruth built\" meaning the great yankee stadium with is seating capacity of more than 70000 which colonel ruppert decided to erect the year previous in order to make himself clear and independent of the giants whose tenant he had been at the polo grounds the right-field bleachers became \"ruthville\" homers soared into them in great abundance and the exploitation of babe ruth the greatest slugger of all times was at is height spent earnings freely but now there crept in a dark episode decidedly less glamorous though spectacular enough and which must be chronicled in order to appreciate more fully the second chapter of the golden harvest money was now pouring upon the babe and was being poured out as speedily in 1921 he had drawn $20000 and the following season he signed a five-year contract at $52000 a season in addition to this he was collecting royalties on all sorts of ventures but money meant nothing to the babe except as a convenient means for lavish entertainment he gambled recklessly lost and laughed uproariously the ruthian waistline began to assume alarming proportions he still took his baseball seriously enough on the field but training had become a horrible bore of such phenomenal strength there seemed to be no limits to his vitality or stamina it was no trick at all for him to spend an evening roistering with convivial companions right through sun- up and until game time the next afternoon and then pound a home run along in the 1924 season colonel ruppert began to fear he had made a mistake in having signed the babe to that long-term contract at $52000 per season which ran from 1922 to 1926 inclusive the yankees lost the pennant that year and there came ominous rumblings that miller huggins the mite manager who had just piloted the yankees through three successful pennant years was not in harmony with the babe at all there even had been trouble back in 1921 when ruth openly flouted commissioner landis by playing on a barnstorming tour that fall after the limit date set by the commissioner the following spring landis in order to demonstrate his authority suspended ruth for thirty days from the opening of the season but it was not until 1925 that the real crash came and high living proved as exacting in collecting its toll as the high commissioner coming north at the end of the training season ruth collapsed at the railroad station at asheville n c from a complication of ailments he was helped aboard the train carried off on a stretcher on the team arrival in new york and spent weeks in a hospital he did not appear again in a yankee line-up until jun 1 nor had all the lesson been yet fully learned later in the same campaign huggins exasperated beyond all measure at the babe wayward way of deporting himself slapped a $5000 fine on him for \"misconduct off the ball field\" it was the highest fine ever imposed on a ball player and ruth at first took it as a joke but huggins stuck by his guns received the backing of colonel ruppert who was now the sole owner of the club and the fine came from the babe pay check now the lesson was learned and another startling change came over the babe he became almost overnight one of miller huggins\\' staunchest supporters he trained faithfully in 1926 hammered forty-seven homers as against a meager twenty-five in 1925 and started the yankees on another pennant-winning era sixty homers a new record sailed off his bat in 1927 and ruth was a greater figure in baseball than ever another pennant followed that year and still another in 1928 on top of which the yankees swept through two world series triumphs in those two years without the loss of a single game became good business man in the spring of 1929 several months after his first wife from whom he had been estranged for a number of years died in a fire in boston the babe married mrs claire hodgson formerly an actress and to her also is given a deal of credit for the complete reformation of the babe who in the closing years of his baseball activities trained as faithfully to fulfill what he considered his obligation to his public as it was humanly possible simultaneously with this ruth suddenly became a shrewd business man with an eye to the future giving heed to the advice of colonel ruppert and ed barrow the babe invested his earnings carefully in 1927 he became the highest salaried player of his time with a three-year contract at $70000 a year in 1930 he signed a two-year contract at $80000 per season but in 1932 acceding to economic pressure of the times accepted a $75000 stipend for one season that proved an excellent investment for the yankees won another pennant that year and defeated the cubs in four straight games ruth causing a sensation by indicating to the spectators in chicago where he meant to hit the ball when he made two home runs in the third game of the series for the championship the next year saw a further decline in the salary of the star to $52000 and in 1934 he signed for $35000 at the close of his baseball career it was estimated that in his twenty-two years in the major leagues he had earned in salaries $896000 plus $41445 as his share of world series receipts in addition he was reputed to have made $1000000 from endorsements barnstorming tours movies and radio appearances as a consequence when he retired the babe was able to live in comfort maintaining a large apartment on new york west side for despite his earlier extravagances he later invested so well he was able to realize a monthly income of $2500 by the time he had reached 45 in addition to the great crowds he had drawn steadily to major league parks he also brought vast sums into the yankee coffers from spring exhibition tours in 1929 and 1930 the yanks booked two tours through texas and the middle west on their way north from the training camp in florida and played to record-smashing crowds that stormed hotel lobbies and blocked traffic in all directions to get a glimpse of baseball most famous character and through all this new homage showered upon him he steadfastly remained the same babe more serious-minded but as cordial and affable as ever the youngsters he worshipped possibly as much as they worshipped him in waco tex he broke up an exhibition game by inviting some of the kids to come out on the field and roll around on the grass they poured out of the stands by the thousands overran the field swamped the local police and ended the game ruth came to the parting of the ways with the yankees after the 1934 season he had always aspired to be a manager and that winter he asked colonel ruppert with his accustomed bluntness to make him leader of the new york team ruppert was satisfied with the results obtained by joe mccarthy in winning the 1962 world series after coming from the cubs in 1931 and refused however he said that he would not stand in the way of ruth if the latter could find a place as manager the opening came in the spring of 1935 when judge emil fuchs then president of the boston national league club offered ruth a contract as a player at $25000 a year with a percentage from exhibition games and a percentage of the gain in the earnings of the club together with a promise of becoming manager the following season ruppert gave ruth his release and he joined the national league team at its training camp in st petersburg fla that spring ruth never was a success with the braves he was his old self as a batsman and player only in spots and the team sank into the national league cellar on may 25 1935 in pittsburgh he showed the last flash of his former greatness when he batted three home runs in consecutive times at bat at forbes field but a week later on june 2 after a dispute with fuchs he asked for and received his release he had several offers from minor league teams after that but refused them all it was not until june 17 1938 that his chance came to re-enter the big leagues then he was named coach of the dodgers burleigh grimes the manager of the team recommending the move said \"you can\\'t keep a man like that out of baseball\" although the team was a loser ruth entered into the work of upbuilding enthusiastically and was hailed with the usual acclaim around the circuit and in towns where he played in exhibition games although ruth continued popularity helped the dodgers to draw additional fans through their turnstiles a service for which the club paid him a $15000 salary he was not re-engaged as coach at the close of the 1938 season it was then that leo durocher was appointed manager to succeed grimes ruth taking his dismissal in good spirit explained that a new manger necessarily would want to make his own choice for the coaching jobs and he wished the dodgers good luck the bambino once again became the retired business man and as he returned to the role of \"baseball forgotten man\" he increased his activities on the links his name soon became associated with some of golf leading players while his scores consistently ran in the low 70 at world fair baseball school however he never overlooked lending a hand to his first love wherever baseball offered him some opportunity for showing himself during 1939 he appeared at the world fair baseball school in the role of instructor took part in the old-timers\\' game in the baseball centennial celebration at cooperstown played a prominent role in the lou gehrig appreciation day ceremonies and in the spring of 1940 appeared for a time with a baseball training school at palatka fla during 1941 ruth principally through the medium of his golfing prowess stayed in the public eye during the summer he engaged in a series of matches with his old diamond rival cobb the proceeds going to the british war relief fund and the united service organizations cobb victor in the first match in boston 3 and 2 lost the second match at fresh meadow new york 1 up on the nineteenth hole but came back to defeat the babe in the deciding tilt in detroit 3 and 2 later in the year ruth signed a contract to appear in the samuel goldwyn motion picture based on the life of his famous team-mate lou gehrig with the babe appearing as himself the babe hit the headlines and frightened his friends before 1942 scarcely had begun on the morning of jan 3 he was removed to a hospital in an ambulance the reason being \"an upset nervous condition partly brought on by an automobile accident in which he was involved but three weeks later ruth was off on a hunting trip in up-state new york and by february was in hollywood teaching gary cooper who was to portray gehrig how to bat left-handed and signing autographs for screen stars on april 9 ruth went to the hollywood hospital suffering from pneumonia and described by his doctor as \"a border line case\" but two days later the babe countless friends and well-wishers were cheered by the same physician statement: \"i believe he is over the hump\" ruth was out of the hospital by april 22 and back on the movie lot to complete his work in the gehrig film during that and succeeding war years ruth answered any and all demands for his appearance at war bond rallies and charity enterprises he played in golf tournaments went bowling and sold bonds on aug 23 1942 he paired with the late walter johnson another of baseball immortals at the yankee stadium to aid in a benefit show for two war services with johnson pitching the babe came through as he always had by hitting a \"home run\" into the right field seats and \"rounding the bases\" via a short cut from first to third base that was his final homer wrong on war prophecy late in 1943 ruth proved a bad prophet when he predicted that major league baseball would become a war casualty in 1944 \"if not sooner\" his prophesying was as wholehearted as his ball playing had been for he said: \"it a cinch they won\\'t open the ball parks next year\" although never realizing an ambition to manage a major league club ruth became manager for a day in mid-july of 1943 when he piloted a team of all-stars including such players as ted williams and dom dimaggio to a triumph over the boston braves as part of a charity field-day program in boston a dozen days later he filled the same role in a similar game at yankee stadium ruth activity in aiding war causes increased in 1944 and it was in march of that year that he was the subject of one of the oddest dispatches of the conflict it came from cape gloucester new britain where united states marines were fighting the japanese and recounted that when the little men charged the marine liens their battle cry was: \"to hell with babe ruth! babe rumbling comment to that was: \"i hope every jap that mentions my name gets shot--and to hell with the japs anyway!\" the babe didn\\'t know or care that nine years before the japanese sounded that battle cry a japanese publisher had been assassinated by a japanese fanatic and that ruth was partly blamed for it the assassin had said the publisher crime was in sponsoring the japanese tour of a group of american ball players headed by babe ruth in june of 1944 ruth went into the hospital once more this time to have a cartilage removed from his knee reports immediately followed that he might try to play ball again as a pinch- hitter early in 1946 ruth took a trip to mexico as a guest of the fabulous pasquel brothers \"raiders\" of american organized baseball this resulted in a rumor that he would become commissioner of the mexican national league the pasquel loop but as usual nothing came of it on his return to new york ruth disclosed that he had sought the manager berth with the newark club owned by the yankees but that \"all i got was a good pushing around\" by larry macphail the babe also praised the pasquels and at the same time revealed that he had turned down an offer of $20000 from the federal league while getting $600 a season from baltimore \"i turned it down because we were told by organized baseball that if we jumped we would be barred for life but nobody was barred for life and i just got jobbed out of $20000 without a thank-you from anybody\" there was scarcely room for real bitterness in the expansive and warm ruthian temperament but the big fellow undoubtedly did feel at times a resentment against the owners in major league baseball because no place in it ever was found for him and whatever slight flame of resentment may have lighted in him was frequently fanned by many writers who openly chided the baseball moguls for sidestepping the great bambino through the unhappy medium of a protracted illness and a serious neck operation that kept him hospitalized from late november 1946 to mid-february 1947 ruth came back into the public eye recurrent reports that his condition was critical resulted in a deluge of messages from sympathetic well-wishers there was general rejoicing among his legions of followers when he was sufficiently recovered to leave the hospital that this feeling was shared in official baseball circles was promptly indicated when baseball commissioner a [missing text] happy chandler paid unprecedented tribute to the sultan of swat by designating april 27 194 [missing text] as \"babe ruth day\" all organized baseball joined on this date in honoring the man who contributed so much to the game ruth himself was present at the yankee stadium where a crowd of 58339 turned out for ceremonies that were broadcast over the world and piped into the other major league ballparks extremely conscious of his debt to the \"kids of america\" to whose loyal support he attributed his success ruth identified himself with welfare programs after his discharge from the hospital he was engaged by the ford motor company as a consultant in connection with its participation in the american legion junior baseball program and he was named by mayor william o\\'dwyer of new york as permanent honorary chairman of the police athletic league in may 1947 he established and made the first contribution to the babe ruth foundation inc an organization whose resources were to be devoted to the interests of underprivileged youth although the ravages of his illness left little of his once robust physique the babe now gaunt bent and his once resonant voice reduced to a rasping whisper continued to astound his physicians by tackling his new job with all his oldtime vigor throughout the summer he made innumerable public appearances all over the country on sunday sept 28 the final day of the 1947 championship season he returned to the yankee stadium to receive another thunderous ovation on this day under the direction of macphail a galaxy of more than forty stars of former yankee and other american league world championship teams assembled to engage in an oldtimers day they included such immortals as ty cobb tris speaker cy young george sisler waite hoyt bob meusel and chief bender and with the babe looking on from a box the grizzled vets played a two-inning game the entire day receipts were turned over to the foundation ruth continued his role as consultant making appearances all over the country he went to hollywood to help with the filming of his life story while there the babe was informed that the yankees were planning to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the yankee stadium he readily agreed to participate in the ceremonies he accepted the managership of the 1923 yankees who were to play an abbreviated exhibition game against later-year yankees to be piloted by barrow june 13 1948 was the date set for \"silver anniversary day\" it turned out to be a memorable day one that ruth despite his physical condition would not have missed for anything despite a wretched day--rain fog etc--the babe donned his old uniform with the no3 on the back when he was introduced and walked slowly to home plate a thunderous ovation from 49641 men women and children greeted him many in the gathering wept as ruth in a raspy voice told how happy he was to have hit the first homer ever achieved in the stadium; how proud he was to have been associated with such fine players and how glad he was to be back with them even if only for a day bob shawkey sad sam jones whitey witt bob meusel waite hoyt carl mays bullet joe bush wally pipp mike mcnally wally schang and others from the 1923 club that annexed the first world championship by a yankee aggregation; bill dickey lefty gomez george selkirk red rolfe and others who came later--all were on hand to pay homage to the babe it was the last time that no 3 was won by a yankee player for the babe turned his uniform over to the hall of fame retired for all time it was sent to the baseball shrine at cooperstown n y where it was placed among the ruth collection there ruth team scored a 2-0 two-inning victory that day and the man to whom a big-league manager job was never given managed a winner in the \"house that ruth built\"',\n",
       " 'washington feb 20--frederick douglass dropped dead in the hallway of his residence on anacostia heights this evening at 7 o\\'clock he had been in the highest spirits and apparently in the best of health despite his seventy-eight years when death overtook him this morning he was driven to washington accompanied by his wife she left him at the congressional library and he continued to metzerott hall where he attended the sessions of the women council in the forenoon and the afternoon returning to cedar hill his residence between 5 and 6 o\\'clock after dining he had a chat in the hallway with his wife about the doings of the council he grew very enthusiastic in his explanation of one of the events of the day when he fell upon his knees with hands clasped mrs douglass thinking this was part of his description was not alarmed but as she looked he sank lower and lower and finally lay stretched upon the floor breathing his last realizing that he was ill she raised his head and then understood that he was dying she was alone in the house and rushed to the front door with cries for help some men who were near by quickly responded and attempted to reassure the dying man one of them called dr j stewart harrison and while he was injecting a restorative into the patient arm mr douglass passed away seemingly without pain mr douglass had lived for some time at cedar hill with his wife and one servant he had two sons and a daughter the children of his first wife living here they are louis h and charles douglass and mrs sprague mr douglass was to deliver a lecture tonight at hillside african church near his home and was waiting for a carriage when talking to his wife the carriage arrived just as he died mrs douglass said to-night that her husband had apparently been in the best of health lately and had shown unusual vigor for one of his years no arrangements she said would be made for his funeral until his children could be consulted it is a singular fact in connection with the death of mr douglass that the very last hours of his life were given in attention to one of the principles to which he has devoted his energies since his escape from slavery this morning he drove into washington from his residence about a mile out from anacostia a suburb just across the eastern branch of the potomac and at 10 o\\'clock appeared at metzerott hall where the women national council is holding its triennial mr douglass was a regularly-enrolled member of the national women suffrage association and had always attended its conventions it was probably with a view to consistency in this respect that he appeared at metzerott hall although it was a secret business session of the council mr douglass was allowed to remain and when the meeting had been called to order by mrs may wright sewall the president of the council she appointed miss susan b anthony and the rev anna h shaw a committee to escort him to the platform where most of the delegates not more than fifty in number were sitting mrs sewall presented mr douglass to the council and contenting himself with a bow in response to the applause that greeted the announcement he took a seat beside miss anthony his lifelong friend nothing to indicate that he was not in his usual good health was remarked at the time and to-night after his death was made known nobody could recall anything in his appearance or actions out of the ordinary except according to the statement of a lady present that he rubbed his left hand constantly with his right as though it were benumbed the morning session lasted until after 12 o\\'clock and just before that hour an informal discussion was started on the proposition that has been mooted for some time to divide the national council into an upper and a lower house mr douglass became much interested in this discussion so much so in fact that when the council reconvened at 4 o\\'clock to give further consideration to the matter he was again present although it had been his intention to return to his home earlier in the day he left the hall on the adjournment of the session about 5 o\\'clock and had been at his home but a short time when his death occurred when miss susan b anthony heard of mr douglass death at the evening session of the council she was very much affected miss anthony has a wonderful control over her feelings but to-night she could not conceal her emotion despite her seventy-five years she immediately announced her intention of going to the douglass homestead near anacostia and had actually started when some of her friends fearful that the journey with its quota of bad roads and the excitement of a visit to the presence of death would have a bad effect on her used persuasion to such an extent that she finally consented to defer the trip until to-morrow she was very much averse to returning to the stage in metzerott hall contending that it would appear unfeeling for her to do so but as a number of the more distinguished members of the council were absent she agreed to take her accustomed place to the right of the presiding officer miss anthony and mr douglass formed an intimate friendship when both resided in rochester ny and that friendship had continued for many decades one incident in connection with her relations with mr douglass was recalled by miss anthony during the early days of the anti- slavery agitation miss anthony and her venerable associate elizabeth cady stanton appeared at an anti-slavery meeting in which frederick douglass was taking a prominent part women were not welcome as public speakers in those days and mr douglass had agreed to read an address prepared by mrs stanton his rendition of her written remarks did not suit that lady and stepping forward she took the paper from his hands with the remark \"here frederick let me read it\" and she did so thus marking the initiative in the appearance of women as actors in public gatherings at to-night meeting of the women council mrs may wright sewall announced the death of mr douglass there was a murmur expressing surprise and sympathy and then the council settled down to the business of the evening the slave who ran away career of the most representative african america has produced frederick douglass has been often spoken of as the foremost man of the african race in america though born and reared in slavery he managed through his own perseverance and energy to win for himself a place that not only made him beloved by all members of his own race in america but also won for himself the esteem and reverence of all fair-minded persons both in this country and in europe mr douglass had been for many years a prominent figure in public life he was of inestimable service to the members of his own race and rendered distinguished service to his country from time to time in various important offices that he held under the government he became well known early in his career as an orator upon subjects relating to slavery he won renown by his oratorical powers both in the northern part of the united states and in england he had become known before the civil war also as a journalist so highly were his opinions valued that he was often consulted by president lincoln after the civil war began upon questions relating to the colored race he held important offices almost constantly from 1871 until 1891 mr douglass perhaps more than any other man of his race was instrumental in advancing the work of banishing the color line mr douglass life from first to last was filled with incidents that gave to it a keen flavor of romance the exact date of his birth is unknown it was about the year 1817 his mother was a negro slave and his father was a white man mr douglass birthplace was on the eastern shore of maryland in the tuckahoe district he was reared as a slave on the plantation of col edward lloyd he was sent when ten years old to one of col lloyd relatives in baltimore here he was employed in a shipyard douglass according to his own story suffered deeply while under the bonds of slavery his superior intelligence made him conscious of his wrongs and rendered him keenly sensitive to his condition the manner in which he acquired the rudiments of his education has become a familiar story he learned his letters it is said from the carpenters\\' marks on planks and timbers in the shipyard he used to listen while his mistress read the bible and at length asked her to teach him to read it for himself all the while he was in the shipyard he continued to pick up secretly all the information he could it was while here too that he heard of the abolitionists and began to formulate plans for escaping to the north he made his escape from slavery sept 3 1838 and came to new-york thence he went to new-bedford where he married he supported himself for two or three years by day labor on the wharves and in the workshops he made a speech in 1841 at an anti-slavery convention held at nantucket that made a favorable impression and he became the agent of the massachusetts anti-slavery society he then traveled four years through new-england lecturing against slavery he went to england in 1845 where his lectures in behalf of the slave won a great deal of attention he also visited scotland ireland and wales mr douglass friends in england feared that he might be captured and forced back into slavery and so they raised 150 by means of which he was afterwards formally manumitted mr douglass often met with many unpleasant experiences while traveling about owing to the prejudice that was felt against his race on one occasion when the passengers on a boat would not allow him to enter the cabin his friend wendell phillips refused to leave him and the two men spent the night together on deck william lloyd garrison had also become interested in young douglass and before douglass went to england had done all he could to assist him in gaining an education throughout the anti-slavery agitation mr douglass efforts in behalf of the slaves was unflagging on returning from england mr douglass founded frederick douglass paper a weekly journal at rochester ny the title was changed to the north star he continued its publication for several years mr douglass and john brown were friends and had the same objects in view douglass however did not approve of brown plan for attacking harper ferry and the men parted some two weeks before the attack was made douglass was in philadelphia the night the harper ferry episode occurred it became plain to him immediately afterward that he could scarcely hope to escape being implicated in the trouble and at the earnest solicitation of his friends he made his escape to canada united states marshals appeared in rochester to apprehend him a few hours after his flight he discovered many years later that a requisition for his arrest had been made by the governor of virginia he went to quebec and thence to england where he remained six or eight months he afterward returned to rochester and again took charge of his paper mr douglass urged upon president lincoln when the civil war began the employment of colored troops and the proclamation of emancipation permission for organizing such troops was granted in 1863 and mr douglass became active in enlisting men to fill the colored regiments notably the fifty-fourth and the fifty-fifth massachusetts mr douglass returned to the lecture field after slavery had been abolished he attracted great crowds wherever he went his appearance on the platform was imposing his height was over 6 feet and his weight was fully 200 pounds his complexion was swarthy rather than black his head was covered with a great shock of white hair a large head low forehead high cheekbones and large mouth with gleaming white teeth were some of the noticeable characteristics of his appearance as a speaker he was characterized by his earnestness he made but few gestures and used simple language he became the editor in 1870 of the new national era in washington which was afterward published by his sons lewis and frederick he received the appointment in 1871 as assistant secretary to the commission to san domingo and on his return from that mission president grant appointed him one of the territorial council of the district of columbia he was elected presidential elector at large for the state of new york in 1872 and was appointed to carry the electoral vote of the state to washington mr douglass was appointed united states marshal for the district of columbia in 1876 and retained that office till 1881 when he became recorder of deeds in the district of columbia president cleveland removed him from that office in 1886 in the autumn of that year he made a third visit to england president harrison made mr douglass minister to haiti in 1889 he resigned this office in august 1891 mr douglass administration in haiti was not entirely satisfactory and for some time previous to his resignation unfavorable repots of the affairs of his office had reached washington mr douglass went to haiti just after the revolution that put hippolyte in power and that country was still in an unsettled condition the haitians did not take kindly to mr douglass because of his race and failed to give him the respect to which his office should have entitled him it was recognized when president harrison appointed him that it was an experiment the outcome of which was very uncertain some one in commenting on mr douglass actions in haiti said that he seemed to consider himself rather the representative of the negro race than the representative of the united states government admiral gheradi who visited haiti while mr douglass was there brought back to washington very unfavorable reports of the condition of affairs there there was a great deal of comment in one way and another and mr douglass thought best to resign he said however that the reports about his having been snubbed by haitian officials had been grossly exaggerated mr douglass wrote several books that have met with considerable sale among them are \"narrative of my experience in slavery\" 1844; \"my bondage and my freedom\" 1855; \"life and times of frederick douglass\" 1881 of recent years he has always been prominent in all movements having in view the social and political advancement of women and no later than yesterday afternoon was a welcome attendant at the session of the women national council where he was honored with a seat on the platform fred douglass was married twice his second wife being miss pitts a white woman from new- york state who was a clerk in the recorder office while he held that position for a time this lost him some case among the people of his own race but his personal standing and over- powering intellectuality quickly dissipated the sentiment that some sought to disseminate to his discredit he was one of the most distinguished-looking men that appeared on the thoroughfares of the capital he was kindly disposed to all courteous and of gentle bearing and by all alike white and black or of whatever creed religion or race the news of his death will meet only with genuine regret there is no end of stories about mr douglass one of his most marked characteristics was his intense dislike to being addressed or spoken of as fred douglass it is told of him that one day when in the east room of the white house on overhearing a woman say \"there fred douglass\" he turned to her made a courtly bow and said \"frederick douglass if you please\" in addressing a colored school march 24 1893 at easton md near his birthplace mr douglass said: \"i once knew a little colored boy whose mother and father died when he was but six years old he was a slave and had no one to care for him he slept on a dirt floor in a hovel and in cold weather would crawl into a mealbag head foremost and leave his feet in the ashes to keep them warm often he would roast an ear of corn and eat it to satisfy his hunger and many times has he crawled under the barn or stable and secured eggs which he would roast in the fire and eat \"that boy did not wear pantaloons as you do but a tow linen shirt schools were unknown to him and he learned to spell from an old webster spelling book and to read and write from posters on cellar and barn doors while boys and men would help him he would then preach and speak and soon became well known he became presidential elector united states marshal united states recorder united states diplomat and accumulated some wealth he wore broadcloth and didn\\'t have to divide crumbs with the dogs under the table that boy was frederick douglass \"what was possible for me is possible for you don\\'t think because you are colored you can\\'t accomplish anything strive earnestly to add to your knowledge so long as you remain in ignorance so long will you fail to command the respect of your fellowmen\"',\n",
       " 'jerusalem israeli sector june 13--prof martin buber the renowned jewish philosopher and educator died here today he was 87 years old professor buber health had been failing since he underwent surgery for a broken leg last april since his release from the hospital last month he had been confined to bed at his home in the residential quarter of talbeih one of the great thinkers of this century dr buber had served as a professor at the hebrew university since his arrival in palestine in 1938 from his native austria his translation of the old testament into german begun with the late franz rosenzweig is considered by many the best in existence since 1951 when he retired from teaching he had held the title of professor emeritus of social philosophy at the university a few weeks ago he received the freedom of jerusalem award the last of many honors accorded him several years ago he was nominated for the nobel prize by the late dag hammarskjold who rarely failed to visit dr buber when his duties as secretary general of the united nations brought him to jerusalem when dr buber died this morning president zalman shazar immediately went to the philosopher home to present his condolences press tributes will not come until tomorrow but the lead item on all the government-controlled radio and news programs was the death of professor buber his leading disciple and closest friend and associate prof shemuel hugo bergman said that with dr buber death \"humanity has lost one of its greatest sons jewry has lost its greatest son and israel has lost her living conscience\" professor buber is survived by two children and several grandchildren views affected christianity martin buber was a religious philosopher whose views on human and divine relationships had a fertilizing effect on the christian world his philosophy of personalism was an amalgam of religious mysticism old testament inspiration modern psychology and earthy common sense it contended that man could achieve an intimate relationship with god through an intimate interrelationship with his fellow man and that each man relationship with god and a fellow man was distinct he strove for a \"a dialogue\" between man and god with man as \"i\" and god as \"thou\" this concept was developed in his major philosophical work \"i and thou\" professor buber views influenced protestant theologians he impressed reinhold niebuhr as \"the greatest living jewish philosopher\" and he was an inspiration in dr niebuhr thinking as well as in that of paul tillich another leading protestant theologian by his emphasis on dialogue professor buber was regarded as a pioneer bridge builder between judaism and christianity his views accented the non-formal aspects of religion as opposed to theological systems saw religion as experience religion for professor buber was experience not dogma he doubted that man was made to conform with canon law or with elaborately worked out plans for existence on the contrary professor buber credo stressed individual responsibility a story that was told to illustrate this point concerned an aged pious man rabbi susya who became fearful as death drew near his friends chided him \"what! are you afraid that you\\'ll be reproached that you weren\\'t moses\" \"no\" the rabbi replied \"that i was not susya\" the responsibility to be oneself means in professor buber view that there is no rigid fate; that man can improve his chances for happiness in fact according to professor buber man has an obligation to achieve an identity by refusing to abdicate his will before the monolithic power of party corporation or state professor buber pointed to the duality of things--love and justice freedom and order good and evil: but he did not suggest a happy middle way between them contraries held inseparable \"according to the logical conception of truth\" he once explained \"only one of two contraries can be true but in the reality of life as one lives it they are inseparable \"i have occasionally described my standpoint to my friends as the \\'narrow ridge\\' i wanted by this to express that i did not rest on the broad upland of a system that includes a series of sure statements about the absolute but on a narrow rocky ridge between the gulfs where there is only the certainty of meeting what remains undisclosed\" professor buber suggested two forms of relationships for man--an i-it relationship and an i- thou the first is impersonal and imperfect an example of the i-it relationship would be where one person treats another as a machine or when lovers find only a projection of themselves in each other in religious matters the i-it is expressed when man abstracts god or regards him as out of reach or builds theological systems in which god is remote or considers god too vast professor buber however did not deny that god was the great mystery of the old testament but he insisted that he was also personal paradox of god noted \"of course\" professor buber wrote \"he [god] is the mysterium tremendum that appears and overthrows but he is also the mystery of the self-evident nearer to me than my i\" the i-thou of professor buber thinking stands for the kind of dialogue--love or even hate--in which two persons face and accept each other as truly human there is in such a dialogue he argued a fusion of choosing and being chosen of action and reaction that engages man highest qualities i-thou meetings he explained are \"strange lyric and dramatic episodes seductive and magical but tearing us away to dangerous extremes  shattering security\" the i-thou relationship because it does away with pretension permits man to meet with himself professor buber said and ultimately it brings man into contact with god whom professor buber called the \"eternal thou\" this supreme confrontation has been described by prof maurice s friedman of sarah lawrence college bronxville ny one of the leading interpreters of buberism it is \"perhaps best understood\" dr freidman wrote in his \"martin buber the life of dialogue\" \"from the nature of the demand which one person makes on another if the two of them really meet if you are to meet me you must become as much of a person as i am in order to remain open to god [man] must change his whole being\" ideal social unit like kibbutz believing that man earthly chore is to realize his distinctiveness through the dialogue process professor buber opposed both rigid individualism and collectivism his social ideal was a small community unit somewhat like the kibbutzim of rural israel professor buber also looked at scripture in a special way the bible in his view was neither an infallible guide to conduct nor a mere collection of legends but a dialogue between israel as thou and god as i because of this interpretation and because professor buber was casual in his observance of talmudic law many orthodox rabbis looked upon him as a heretic as for reform jews some of them also criticized professor buber because they thought he had made too much of the metaphysical hasidic sect from which he drew many of his ideas many jews also were dismayed by the application that professor buber made of his beliefs in calling for an improvement of arab-israeli relations this attitude rested on professor buber assertion that \"the love of god is unreal unless it is crowned with love for one fellow men\" he was small and bearded professor buber was a short plump man with a large paunch he was bald with a fringe of hair that hung down to meet the luxurious growth of mustache and beard that concealed the lower part of his face he lived in an old arab stone house with red tile roof and garden in the section of jerusalem that before israel independence was the quarter of the wealthy arab merchants dr buber house had belonged to an arab christian family who left jerusalem shortly before the war broke out in 1948 he lived simply in the house his study and bedroom were on the ground floor the furniture was old and dark and heavy and looked as if it had been brought from vienna the house was filled with books he lived with his granddaughter barbara goldschmitt who served as his housekeeper his secretary was often there but did not live in the house for several years dr buber had not been active outside his home because of periodic spells of illness and advancing age but he loved to have visitors and to talk endlessly when a caller phoned he would hear a click and then a quick sharp one word response: \"buber\" received in shirt sleeves when receiving visitors in his study dr buber would be without tie in shirt sleeves and slippers behind his desk he did not like general questions and frequently prompted his questioner with \"be specific\" he got angry with anyone who tried to ask him personal anecdotal questions insisting that his personal life was just that in conversation he would rest his interlocked fingers on his paunch and then move them to his forehead as he considered his response he weighted every word and when he finally answered it would be in a very slow low voice that seemed tinged with melancholy professor buber gave up lecturing at the hebrew university in 1951 when he ended his active life as an educator however it is recalled that some of his lectures on philosophy were reminiscent of the atmosphere that might have distinguished the socratic dialogues on other occasions while lecturing he showed the zeal and earnestness even veneration with which hasidic students are said to follow the words and teachings of their rabbi on his 85th birthday in 1963 about 300 students of the university staged a torchlight parade to the philosopher house to pay homage to him they swarmed into his garden and in the darkness illuminated by the flames he walked out onto his veranda his face wreathed in smiles deeply appreciative of the gesture the students sang to him and he talked briefly to them as they listened in silence and then they all went into his house for cookies and soft drinks six months later professor buber flew to amsterdam to accept one of europe highest prizes the $28000 erasmus award presented to persons who have contributed to the spiritual unity of europe previous winners included karl jaspers the philosopher and marc chagall the painter born in vienna in 1878 martin buber was born in vienna feb 8 1878 of middle-class parents who were divorced when he was 3 years old he spent much of his childhood in lemberg galicia [now lvov ukrainian soviet socialist republic] with his grandfather salomon buber a well-known hebrew scholar while studying the talmud with his grandfather he also read poetry and novels and occasionally visited neighboring towns where he met hasidic rabbis--holy men who could lead a community united by its love of god and its veneration for a wise man when he was 13 he began a drift away from formal judaism this was symbolized by his offering a bar mitzvah synagogue talk on schiller the dramatist rather than on a scriptural subject later he gave up the daily prayer ritual but not without misgivings that almost led him to suicide because of what he said later was \"a mysterious and overwhelming compulsion\" to visualize the \"limiting brink of time--or its limitlessness\" he was rescued he said by reading immanuel kant and perceiving as a result \"an eternal far removed from the finite and the infinite\" he entered the university of vienna at 17 and studied philosophy and the history of art there and at the universities of berlin zurich and leipzig he received a ph d from vienna in 1904 but he did not use the title it was at the university of leipzig in 1900 that the scholar was caught up by theodor herzl zionism in which he found not only a political movement that suited him but also a religious idea that helped to resolve his spiritual confusion edited zionist journal in 1901 he came editor of die welt the zionist journal and the following year he helped to found judischer verlag a jewish publishing house one of the writers for die welt was paula winkler a brilliant aristocratic roman catholic she subsequently was married to professor buber converting to judaism and remained at his side until her death in 1958 in her own right mrs buber was a novelist under the name georg munk meanwhile there was a split in zionism professor buber was one of those who believed that a spiritual revival was more urgent than political nationhood mr herzl favored a political solution in the course of the division professor buber dropped out of active zionism and retired into solitude for five years he passed that time in remote jewish villages in what was then galicia now poland living among the hasidim and studying their literature and their zaddickim or holy men joy impressed him at the time this grass-roots judaism was considered as bordering on the occult but professor buber found in hasidism an experience of direct communion with the divine he was also impressed by the joy--the ecstatic dance and the wordless song--with which they worshipped the hasidic folklore in its simplicity was profound he believed returning from his retreat among the hasidim professor buber was active in jewish journalism editing from 1916 to 1924 der jude a periodical of the german jews from 1926 to 1930 in concert with a catholic and a protestant he edited the journal die kreatur at the same time he was professor of comparative religion at the university of frankfurt from 1923 to 1933 when the nazis excluded jewish students from institutions of higher learning in 1933 professor buber helped to set up adult education classes for them dr buber was dismissed from his professorship he spoke out however once lecturing on \"the power of the spirit\" in berlin although he knew that 200 ss elite guard men were in the audience utterly silenced in 1938 he went to palestine where he was professor of social philosophy at the hebrew university until his retirement in 1951 professor buber was a prodigious writer more than 700 books and papers by him are listed in one \"selected\" bibliography many of them deal with aspects of the i-thou philosophy he was also a translator of renown in israel professor buber was not a conformist for example he opposed the execution of adolf eichmann the nazi put to death by israel for crimes against the jews \"for such crimes\" he said at the time \"there is no penalty\" he took the position that where the imagination cannot envision a suitable penalty for such horrendous crimes as eichmann a death penalty was meaningless professor buber visited the united states in 1951 the lectures he delivered here were later published as \"eclipse of god\" and \"at the turning\" he received the universal brotherhood award from the union theological seminary and an honorary doctor of letters degree from the hebrew union college in cincinnati',\n",

values are what ought to be \"i would say that all traditional philosophies up to and including marxism have tried to derive the \\'ought\\' from the \\'is\\' my point of view is that this is impossible this is a farce\" dr monod maintained that the impossibility of deriving a set of values--the \"ought\" from blind happenstance or the \"is\"--imposes on mankind the obligation to choose a system of values by which to live but he thought mankind was failing to do so \"there is absolutely no doubt that the risk of the race committing suicide is very great\" he said adding \"in my opinion the future of mankind is going to be decided within the next two generations\" dr monod said his own values were based on the existentialist ethics of his friend the late albert camus--\"an ethics based on free choice\"--and he denied that his intention was to create a philosophy of pessimism or despair hero of the resistance indeed his own life belied the somber reflections his book--a best-seller in france in 1970 and 1971--engendered a dapper urbane man who played the cello and loved to sail jacques lucien monod was also a hero of the french resistance he held both the croix de guerre and the american bronze star he was born in paris in 1910 the son of lucien monod a painter and charlotte todd macgregor monod a native of milwaukee he studied at the cannes lycee and the university of paris and joined the pasteur institute as a zoology instructor in 1931 he was named head of the institute laboratory in 1945 head of the department of cellular biochemistry in 1954 and director in 1971 dr monod was a professor on the faculty of sciences at the university of paris from 1959 to 1967 and a professor of molecular biology at the college de france from 1967 to 1972 he was a rockefeller foundation fellow in 1936 and was named a nonresident fellow of the salk institute in 1968 americans made offers he was a frequent and open critic of the french government for what he saw as its parsimonious treatment of scientific research particularly of research at the pasteur institute just after winning the nobel prize in 1965 professor monod disclosed that most of his and his colleagues\\' research had been done \"in a small stuffy sordid attic room\" and he said that all three of them had earlier turned down a chance to move to the united states to work \"the americans did not make this offer in order to deprive france of its researchers\" he said at the time \"bout only through generosity to permit us to work in decent conditions with a maximum of efficiency\" dr monod could have moved to the united states with relative ease he spoke english with almost no trace of an accent and he was already a member of the academy of arts and sciences appealed for support in 1973 dr monod visited this country in an attempt to save the pasteur institute from bankruptcy he noted he had trimmed the staff patented a new influenza vaccine in the name of the institute and had appealed for both governmental and private support the institute was founded by louis pasteur in 1888 with public donations including large grants from the czar of russia the sultan of turkey and the emperor of brazil pasteur was buried there in 1895 eight men who worked or studied there have won nobel prizes in medicine or physiology the institute is divided into a research section and a pharmaceutical-manufacturing section that grosses more than $20 million in sales a year after taking over in 1971 dr monod dismissed more than 130 scientists and technicians or about 10 percent of the staff dr monod who acknowledged several years ago that running the pasteur institute gave him no time for his own research projects was honored by the nobel committee for showing how the living cell manufactures the substances of life control of protein manufacture with professor jacob he demonstrated how the cell production of proteins is controlled by a feedback process analogous to that by which a thermostat controls the temperature in a room they found that while one type of gene in a cell nucleus holds the blueprints for the substances to the manufactured another gene regulates the rate of production based on whether a given protein is in long or short supply this is the mechanism that permits the required coordination of all the molecular manufacturing activities that are the essence of the metabolism and thus of life itself dr monod was a member of the washington academy of science the royal society of london and the czechoslovak academy of science his wife the former odette bruhl whom he married in 1938 died in 1972 two sons survive',\n",
       " 'moscow tuesday may 31--boris pasternak noted russian poet author of the controversial novel \"doctor zhivago\" and winner of the 1958 nobel prize for literature died in his sleep last night family friends reported he was 70 years old as a result of the novel--never published in the soviet union but a best-seller in western countries--mr pasternak was the center of world-wide uproar the novel was judged highly for literary merit and insights into communist society mr pasterak became ill on may 1 at his home in peredelkino a writers\\' colony about twenty miles outside of moscow along with a heart ailment he suffered from lung cancer stomach bleeding and other infirmities spanned joy and pathos the life of boris pasternak spanned the heights and depths the glories and tragedies the joy and pathos that was russia of the twentieth century so closely was he identified with the soil the history the tradition and the mystery of russia that he could not imagine life away from the land where he was born on feb 10 1890 at the peak of the political controversy within the soviet union over his great novel \"doctor zhivago\" and the award to him of the nobel prize communist propagandists demanded that he leave russia mr pasternak wrote a letter to premier khrushchev declining the nobel prize and adding what his friends felt was the simple truth: \"leaving the motherland will equal death for me i am tied to russia by birth by life and work\" world fame came to mr pasternak very late in life--with the publication of \"doctor zhivago\" the award to it in 1958 of the nobel prize its translation into dozens of languages and almost overpowering barrage of publicity in every kind of media but long before this he had taken his place in the literary life of russia as one of the great masters of the century mr pasternak had made his mark and reputation before the bolshevik revolution his place in the high ranks of russian poetry was secure even before world war i by the late nineteen thirties mr pasternak was turning more and more to the translation of foreign classics his translations into russian of shakespeare hamlet\" \"henry iv\" \"romeo and juliet\" \"anthony and cleopatra\" and \"othello\" are of a quality seldom equaled considered himself a poet it was as a poet that mr pasternak made his mark in the world and it was a poet that he considered himself the fact that his world fame was based upon a novel he regarded as more an accident of time place and history than anything else the publication of \"doctor zhivago\" was the great literary event of postwar russia yet the novel still has not been published in the land of its composition by early 1954 the novel had been reduced to approximately the shape in which it finally was published some poetical excerpts from it were published in a moscow literary journal arrangements had been made to serialize it in the leading soviet magazine novy mir and book publication was under contract when giangiacomo feltrinelli an italian publisher visited moscow mr pasternak readily gave him a copy of the book for publication in italy it was to be brought out simultaneously with the soviet edition but publishing and politics are inextricably intertwined in russia by 1956 despite--and in part because of--the anti-stalin revelations of mr khrushchev the whole of soviet policy was in flux concern was widespread over the consequences of too rapid relaxation the symptoms of the polish and hungarian uprisings were only too apparent on the political landscape in this atmosphere the decision to publish \"doctor zhivago\" in russia was countermanded book widely acclaimed every effort was made to withdraw the manuscript from signor feltrinelli but it was in vain the book was published abroad acclaimed in a torrent of adjectives such as had not been poured out upon a russian writer since the time of tolstoy chekhov and turgenev the central figure in \"dr zhivago\" yuri zhivago is the son of a rich pre-revolutionary russian industrialist an excellent physician he studies philosophy and literature and develops ideas of his own--his main aim being to preserve his own spiritual independence he welcomes the russian revolution enjoying its dream of universal justice but when the communists start telling him how to live and how to think he rebels he leaves moscow for a tiny village beyond the urals where the main romantic theme of the novel develops his loved one is exiled to manchuria by the soviet government and he returns to moscow a broken man to die in the street of a heart attack novy mir said that the spirit of the book was that of \"nonacceptance of the socialist revolution\" soviet writers heaped scorn on mr pasternak calling him a \"traitor\" a \"bourgeois reactionary\" a \"malevolent philistine\" and a \"low-grade hack\" mr pasternak was a product of the rich intellectual tradition and ferment of ideas that stirred middle-class russia in the years immediately preceding world war i and the 1917 revolutions he was one of four children of leonid osipovich pasternak and roza kaufmann pasternak his parents were of jewish descent and he was brought up in a household in which the great poets painters musicians and writers of russia were visitors mr pasternak mother was a concert pianist his first urging was to a life of music he felt strongly under the influence of scriabin and it was his ambition to become a composer too however the young pasternak lacked absolute pitch and suddenly and apparently without regret he gave up his musical ambitions his next interest was philosophy he studied under the famous prof hermann cohen a disciple of hegel and kant at the university of marburg after having attended the moscow gymnasium and moscow university by 1913 however mr pasternak had finally found his metier--poetry after traveling in italy he settled down in moscow and devoted himself to muse his poetry was deeply lyrical filled with magnificent imagery and strongly under the influence of symbolism--one of the dominant literary tendencies of pre-world war i russia mr pasternak did not see military service in the czar army because of a leg injury he did spend some time--a year or two--working in a remote area of the urals in a munitions plant like almost all russian intellectuals he welcomed the 1917 revolution which long had been awaited by the nation writers and artists he was not however attracted by the bolshevik movement although in the early days he worked under the bolshevik government in the commissariat of education one of the questions that never was fully clarified during mr pasternak life was the nature of his relationship with stalin there were many who felt that in some manner he had come under stalin protection and that this was the reason why mr pasternak seemed to lead a charmed life during the purges of the nineteen thirties beginning in 1957 almost every foreign literary musical or creative figure to journey to moscow made the pilgrimage to peredelkino the pilgrimage was halted only for a few months after the enormous agitation over \"doctor zhivago\" there was evidence that premier khrushchev himself had intervened to end the attacks on mr pasternak whatever the cause it was apparent that there were profound second thoughts about the persecution of mr pasternak all of the leading literary and party figures who participated in the verbal lynching were downgraded or demoted mr pasternak put aside the translation task he had tackled at the height of the \"zhivago\" controversy--a new version of tagore--and turned to a work dear to his heart a play centering on alexander ii freeing of the serfs in 1856 he was hard at work on this project late in 1959 and early this year and was still talking of another novel that he planned to write--for he was far from satisfied with \"doctor zhivago\" his other principal works in english translation include \"childhood\" published in 1941; \"collected rose works\" in 1945; \"selected poems\" in 1946 and \"selected writings\" in 1949 his first book of poems \"twin in the clouds\" appeared in 1914 the author was married twice he and his first wife eugenia were divorced in 1931 his second wife was the former zinaida nikolaevna neuhaus he had three sons--a pianist an engineer and a physics student mr pasternak parents had migrated to england about the time of the revolution he had two sisters lydia and josephine living there and a brother alexander an architect in moscow in one of the poems included at the end of \"doctor zhivago\" mr pasternak says through the voice of hamlet: the stir is over i step fourth on the boards leaning against an upright at the entrance i strain to make the far-off echo yield a cue to the events that may come in my day the order of the acts has been schemed and plotted and nothing can avert the final curtain fall i stand alone all else is swamped by pharisaism to live life to the end is not a childish task the words might well have served as the poet epitaph',\n",
       " 'thomas alva edison made the world a better place in which to live and brought comparative luxury into the life of the workingman no one in the long roll of those who have benefited humanity has done more to make existence easy and comfortable through his invention of electric light he gave the world a new brilliance; when the cylinder of his first phonograph recorded sound he put the great music of the ages within reach of every one; when he invented the motion picture it was a gift to mankind of a new theatre a new form of amusement his inventions gave work as well as light and recreation to millions his inventive genius brooded over a world which at nightfall was engulfed in darkness pierced only by the feeble beams of kerosene lamps by gas lights or in some of the larger cities by the uncertainties of the old-time arc lights to edison with the dream of the incandescent lamp in his mind it seemed that people still lived in the dark ages but his ferreting fingers groped in the darkness until they evoked the glow that told him the incandescent lamp was a success and that light for all had been achieved that significant moment occurred more than fifty years ago- -on oct 21 1879 the miracles of menlo park a blustering wind beat gustily on the unpainted boards of a small laboratory in menlo park nj a tall lean figure stooped over a shaky table his steel-blue eyes filled with the impassioned light of discovery beside him was a thin nervous assistant the dull golden glow of kerosene lamps puffing off an oily odor cast grotesque shadows on the walls as every chance gust of air down the lamp chimneys twisted the erratic flame straining weary eyes in the dim and uneven light the assistant fluttered the pages of a notebook- -jottings on a miracle about to be performed the corners of the laboratory were deep in shadow and the outside world was a waste of darkness shot by occasional rifts of light a few miles away was new york with gas light in some of its homes but table lamps still a household necessity the hoofbeats of its leisurely traffic passed along streets brightened only by the pale yellow pools of light that circled the wide-spaced lamp posts on broadway the fabled midnight supper of the victorian era was served under crystal chandeliers and gas globes; there was no spotlight in the theatres and the footlights were feeble gestures at illumination the two men in the laboratory were looking from a dim present into a dazzling future from darkness to broadway brightest display gravely francis jehl told mr edison that the lamp on the table had a good vacuum an organ pump in a corner was started to force the air from the lamp a minute or two went by in breathless silence then the inventor tested the vacuum it was right and he told jehl to seal the lamp the great moment was at hand they moved to the dynamo and started it light sprang from the lamp like a newly created world to the watching men edison put on more power he thought the makeshift filament would burst instead it grew bright more power and more light at last it broke but the incandescent lamp had been invented tribute of a world aglow fifty years later the fruition of that night work was dramatized in the golden anniversary of the electric light broadway piccadilly the champs elysees unter den linden flashed in golden brilliance cape town rio de janeiro peiping bangkok melbourne moscow--cities the world over blazed an unconscious tribute and at dearborn mich edison feebly re-lived that memorable night in the history of scientific progress in a reconstructed menlo park with president hoover and henry ford looking on he and his faithful aide re-enacted the discovery of a half a century before but with a different climax the original scene at menlo park had been faithfully reproduced and every light extinguished except the oil burners in the laboratory itself at the second that the filament burned and mr edison turned with a smile to the president the dim yellow flame of the oil lamps leaped to a golden spray of amperes as a ford foreman pulled a master switch dearborn leaped from the darkness and powerful lights turned the night into noontime buildings emerged in twinkling frames and airplanes with their wings and fuselage outlined in electric lights dipped and circled as the inventor now grown feeble and silver-haired returned to the dining hall to hear the president hail him as the benefactor of all mankind he counted this the best of his gifts to humanity the magic release of music then in 1877 edison invented the cylinder phonograph a crude affair which was not perfected until 1890 and which was still undergoing refinement when world war broke out in 1914 the average parlor music up to that time was provided by the harmonium or the piano on which some musical maid practiced her scales or laboriously picked out tunes like \"hearts and flowers\" there was a monotony and a tameness to the household melody even in the cities and the fiddle held undisputed sway in rural districts then came the phonograph--at first a novelty then a luxury and finally a commonplace it brought the great arias of opera into the tenements caruso voice soared for flat-faced tibetans in the hill villages near darjeeling traders saw to it that the spear-carrying natives of central africa had a chance to hear crack orchestras from broadway and piccadilly grind out jazz with a faintly reminiscent note and fifty years from now the voice of caruso and all his contemporaries will be heard by those not yet born edison had a hand even in the perfection of the radio that invention which has given his phonograph a back seat in the march of progress in 1876 he perfected the carbon telephone transmitter which in turn helped in the evolution of the microphone to complete his contribution to radio it should be pointed out that in 1883 while studying the flow of current he evolved what is known as the edison effect this in principle is the basis for the de forest radio lamp or tube stilled images brought to life he first produced a motion picture camera in 1887 but it was not until 1891 that he perfected it curiously enough this historic machine did not interest him to any great extent he failed utterly to envision hollywood and the huge industry that his genius made possible to edison a succession of flashes thrown on a screen so rapidly that they made a continuous picture had possibilities only as peep shows in penny arcades when some one suggested that the pictures be shown in theatres he demurred on the ground that to do so would interfere with the arcades he did harbor the idea however that the pictures might be synchronized with the phonograph this he never worked out because of the failure of his early attempt to link conversation to moving pictures thus he permitted others to carry on his pioneering in this fertile field but it is because of his early discoveries that america leads the world in screen effects and that the penny arcade with its shooting gallery and knockout fight films has yielded to the cathedrals of the screen also because of edison it is possible for the natives of kamchatka to sit impassively row upon row and see how the high school champion diving team of rural centre ill put on a water carnival and raised money to pay the church mortgage and vice versa for the students of rural centre to see what the well-controlled native of bengal does when a hungry tiger charges him edison did more than light the lamp at menlo park',\n",
       " 'the announcement that charles robert darwin died on wednesday at his residence down house near orpington will be read by very few individuals who have not some degree of acquaintance with the physical theories formulated and taught by this distinguished naturalist however scanty may be their actual knowledge of his works darwin has been read much but talked about more since the publication of his work \"on the origin of species\" in 1859 and particularly within the 11 years which have elapsed since his \"descent of man\" was given to the world he has been the most widely known of living thinkers doctrines such as he set forth could not long remain the exclusive property of philosophers nor of educated people they made their way at once into the reading and thought of the masses until the slightest allusion to darwinism was sure of instant recognition from even the most illiterate individual or audience it is not to be supposed that every country clergyman with a library not extending far beyond richard baxter jortin bishop berkeley and a commentary or two became profoundly versed in the doctrines of evolution or that little laughing schoolgirls joking each other about a monkey ancestry had followed mr darwin very far in his speculations on differentiation of species but the ministers somehow all knew that evolution was an abominable heresy to be by * * * and example thrust out of men minds and the school children intuitively understood that if man is descended from the ape he cannot be descended from adam all that part of the world which had never thought of such things before was aroused by the shock of the new idea previous speculations upon the origin of man had it is safe to say been the diversion of the learned; the people at * * * had no part in them but here was a scientist not a speculative philosopher who dealt with facts and logical differences in a new way and he speedily had the whole world for an audience everybody saw that the history of living forms as the books taught it was widely at variance with the mosaic account of creation and from the moment when the darwinian theory of evolution was publicly stated the modern struggle between science and theological dogma took its rise there had been skeptics and atheists and deists and what not before but what grave essayists call scientific unbelief sprang primarily from works of charles darwin and is fed chiefly from the writings of other scientists who are at work extending and completing the frame work be erected mr darwin therefore may be called a epoch-making man the qualities and natural bent of his clear mind were inherited his father and grandfather were naturalists though the latter dr erasmus darwin was a much more famous and productive man than his son dr r w darwin erasmus darwin a botanist of renown is best known as the author of a remarkable poem called the \"botanic garden\" which though destitute of the poetic feeling shows its author to have been deeply versed in the linaean system of botany of dr r w darwin little is known save that he was a member of the royal society charles robert darwin was born at shrewsbury england feb 12 1809 his early education was received in the shrewsbury grammar school under the tuition of dr butler in 1825 when he was 16 years old he entered edinburgh university and remained there two years going then to christ college cambridge where he received the degree of bachelor of arts in 1831 in december of the same year he was selected as a naturalist to make a voyage of scientific exploration around the world on board the ship beagle five years were spent in this way we may fairly suppose that mr darwin was a naturalist of some competence and training when he set out on this voyage the opportunities for research experiment and study which it gave him particularly during his stay in south america were fruitful in the material and hints out of which his later theories were evolved indeed in geographical and geological distribution mr darwin found the weightiest proofs of the truth of his system returning from this voyage in 1836 he began the preparation of a \"journal of researches\" into the geology and natural history of the countries visited by the expedition this was published as part of capt fitzray \"narrative of the surveying voyages of h m s beagle and adventurer\" in succeeding years he edited in five parts the \"zoology of the voyage of the beagle\" the notes of the habits and range of mammalia being by his hand out of the material obtained on this cruise he prepared for publication in 1842 \"the structure and distribution of coral reefs;\" in 1874\"geological observations on south america\" between 1844 and 1859 his publications were mostly brief monographs contributed to scientific publications or read before learned societies but during this long period of slight literary productivity he occupied himself with untiring zeal and systematic regularity in the study of nature making a series of observations upon the forms and habits of animals plants and minerals--for it is hard to say whether he was most eminent in zoology botany or geology-- and slowly accumulating that vast mass of facts and registered phenomena to which he was later on to apply his theory of evolution the publication in 1859 of his work \"on the origin of species by means of natural selection; or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life\" was the announcement to his friends that he had at length passed over the sea of hypothesis to the firm ground of scientific assertion and to the world that it must revise or fortify its opinions on biological subjects after making in 1862 one of those excursions into the by-ways of scientific inquiry of which he was so fond of which the outcome was his work on \"the various contrivances by which orchids are fertilized by insects\" and still another in 1865 to publish the well-known book on \"the movements and habits of climbing plants\" he put forth in 1868 another important work on \"the variation of animals and plants under domestication\" in two volumes in 1871 appeared the best known of all his books \"the descent of man and selection in relation to sex\" in two volumes the following year saw the publication of \"the expression of the emotions in man and animals;\" in 1875 appeared \"insectiverous plants;\" in 1876 \"the effects of cross and self- fertilization in the vegetable kingdom;\" in 1877 \"the different forms of flowers and plants of the same species\" and in 1881 \"the power of movement in plants\" each of these books has its place in the development of the theory which bears their author name all of them even those which concern only a single order of the phenomena abound in illustrations pertinent to his great theme and supply those who wish to use or investigate his theories with the classified results of his accurate observations but it is upon the \"origin of species\" and the \"descent of man\" in which the theory of evolution is made to tell the history of life upon the earth as we now see it that his fame chiefly rests if asked to define darwinism the orthodox antagonist of the scientific unbelief of the day will reply that it is an attempt to show how blind matter became the seeing eye; the biologist of the haeckel school will say that it is a description of the mechanical process by which the cosmic system was produced out of elementary matter acted upon by its own laws neither definition is correct for mr darwin made an extremely modest use of his great attainments he did not construct a theory of the cosmos and he did not deal with the entire theory of evolution he was content to leave others to poke about in the original protoplasmic mire and to extend the evolutionary law to social and political phenomena for himself he tried to show how higher organic forms were evolved out of lower he starts with life already existing and traces it through its successive forms up to the highest--man the central principle--his opponents call it a dogma--of mr darwin system is \"natural selection\" called by herbert spencer \"the survival of the fittest\" a choice which results inevitably from \"the struggle for existence\" it is a law and fact in nature that there shall be the weak and the strong the strong shall triumph and the weak shall go to the wall the law though involving destruction is really preservative if all plants and animals were free to reproduce their kind under like and equally favorable conditions if all were equally strong and well equipped for obtaining sustenance and making their way in the world there would soon be no room on the earth for even a single species thirty millions of men in less than 700 years of unchecked reproduction under the conditions we have mentioned would have living offspring enough to cover the whole earth at the rate of one for each square foot of its surface the limit of subsistence and the power of reproduction are the bounds between which the conflict rages in this struggle the multitudes are slain and the few survive but the survivors do not owe their good luck to chance their adaptation to their surroundings is the secret of their exemption from the fate which overtakes those less happily circumstanced a variety of squirrels for instance which is capable of wandering far afield in pursuit of its food which is cunning and swift enough to evade its enemies and has a habit of providing a store of nuts for winter use will naturally have a better chance of survival than a variety deficient in these qualities but mr darwin also discovered that natural selection created special fitness for given circumstances and surroundings climate soil food supply and other conditions act in this way and the result is the differentiation of species a certain thistle grows in a kind of soil which is rich in the elements which go to produce the tiny hairs upon the surface of the plant the seeds are thus furnished with downy wings longer than usual and are wafted further off where they have plenty of space to grow and they in turn reproduce and emphasize the changes to which they owe their existence seeds or nuts developing a thick covering for the kernel are thus protected from birds and animals and live to germinate producing also hard-shelled seeds and thus the process goes on varieties which do not develop a high degree of special adaptation to their surroundings fall out of the race unable to defend themselves against their innumerable aggressors an infinitesimally minute variation of function or structure repeated and becoming more marked through many successive generations results ultimately in the production of a variety; or even of a species quite unlike the parent individual mr darwin was by no means the discoverer of the theory of evolution that is at least as old as aristotle who supposed individuals to be produced not by a simultaneous creation of a minute copy of the adult with all the different organs but by epigenisis--that is by successive acts of generation or growth in which the rudiment or cell received additions other ancient philosophers and in more modern times descartes spinoza leibnitz bonnet lamarck and cuvier have adopted and used this theory to a greater or less extent but it never had a substantial basis of fact or a thoroughly scientific application until mr darwin worked it out others as we have said and notably mr spencer have given it a more comprehensive scope but within the limits he set for himself mr darwin meets no rival claimant for the honors the scientific and thinking world have accorded him the dispatch announcing his death says that he had been suffering for some time from weakness of the heart but continued to work to the last he was taken ill on tuesday night with pains in the chest faintness and nausea the nausea lasted more or less during wednesday and culminated in death in the afternoon mr darwin remained fully conscious until within a quarter of an hour of his death',\n",

heart disease and pneumonia of both lungs she had had serious valvular heart trouble for the last six or seven years her lungs were practically clear and the pneumonia had yielded to treatment but the

feb 20 in honor of her eighty-sixth birthday but she had an attack of neuralgia on feb 18 and hastened home pneumonia developed after her arrival here and on march 5 both her lungs became affected she rallied but had a relapse three days ago and the end after that never was in doubt miss anthony herself had believed that she would recover early in her illness she told her friends that she expected to live to be as old as her father who was over 90 when he died but on wednesday she said to her sister: \"write to anna shaw immediately and tell her i desire that every cent i leave when i pass out

amarillo tex and portland me the plays in addition to \"the barretts\" were \"candida\" and \"romeo and juliet\" \"we opened up the road\" miss cornell said \"we made \\'the barretts\\' and \\'candida\\' pay for shakespeare \\'the barretts\\' never played to an empty house--the receipts would be something like $33000 then about $28000 for \\'candida\\' and for \\'juliet\\' about $18000 to $19000 so that we came back having more than broken even we really felt prideful \"we continued like that for many years alternatively new york with the road paying for ourselves with sidney howard \\'alien corn\\' shaw \\'st joan\\' and \\'the doctor dilemma\\' and some of the others--until later on when costs got too high with \\'anthony and cleopatra\\' we had to call in angels\" the audience waited miss cornell hold on her audiences was astonishing one christmas day the troupe was on its way from montana to seattle for a week engagement opening that evening floods delayed the train and at curtain time the actors were far from seattle and resigned to missing the performance--and their pay for it the train finally arrived at 11:15 and the group discovered that the audience was still waiting the curtain rose at 1:05 and mr woollcott who was present described the experience: \"the excitement the heady compliment paid by the audience in having waited at all acted like wine on the spirits of the troupe and they gave the kind of performance one hopes for on great occasions and never gets\" the actress skill on the stage was all the more remarkable because she was usually nervous and fidgety before she went on \"i was nervous from the very beginning and it got worse as the years went on\" she once confessed adding: \"i was conscientious and wanted to do more always than i was able i don\\'t think when i was playing that i was ever happy--beginning at 4 o\\'clock any afternoon\" born in berlin katharine cornell bent for acting was familial since both her grandfather and her father were both actors manque she was the only child of dr peter c and alice cornell and she was born in berlin where her father was studying surgery the precise date was a mystery for years she said it was feb 16 1898; but when she was in her 70 she offered the year as 1893 explaining: \"when an actress is younger she likes to lower her age but when she is older she likes to add to her years\" in any event katharine had an early exposure to the theater in buffalo where the family lived for many years and where her father quit medicine to manage a playhouse \"i drifted into acting\" she once remarked \"my grandfather had a house in buffalo in which there was a stage and his friends met every two weeks or so to put on plays \"so it was natural for met to put on plays too when i went to boarding school i put on everything in the drama--i was indiscriminate i put on yeats and shaw and lady gregory\" her first professional opportunity came when the director of the washington square players visited her school in mamaroneck ny to do a play recalling the occasion miss cornell said: \"[eddie goodman] told me to come and see him if i ever wanted a job when i did he gave me a part in \\'bushido\\' a no drama they were putting on all i got to say was \\'my son my son\\'; it was a very exciting moment when they told me i could have the part that was in 1917 \"i sort of slid from one thing to another after that i was with the jessie bonstelle stock company in detroit and buffalo for three seasons--10 performances and a new play every week she was an amazing woman who did a great deal for me\" one of the things miss bonstelle did for miss cornell was to take her to london as jo in \"little women\" she was seen there by among others two scottish women who urged her upon allen pollock a producer who was searching for an actress for clemence dane \"a bill of divorcement\" to be presented in new york she got the part of an ingenue and she had a personal triumph when the play opened in 1921 it ran for two seasons after appearing in some indifferent dramas she did the title role in \"candida\" in 1924 to critical raves one of them read: \"the tenderness the poetry the supreme womanliness of katharine cornell impersonation of the title part puts this actress a notch ahead of anything she has yet attempted it is an impersonation touched by the wand of genius\" then there was \"the green hat\" and assured stardom status that pulled through such dubious dramas as \"dishonored lady\" and \"the age of innocence\" in the late twenties whatever the role miss cornell declined to have retrospective regrets \"the audience may not have felt it was right and the author may have felt a little upset but every part i\\'ve played i\\'ve twisted around in my mind until i\\'ve made it into something of my own\" she said \"looking back over it i didn\\'t deliberately sit down and plan like that but it does read like it\" most of her plays were chosen by her husband \"who gave me the confidence needed\" \"guthrie persuaded me to do shakespeare and i was very frightened of shakespeare she remarked adding: \"there are some plays we never got around to doing shaw \\'heartbreak house\\' for example but i simply could not find my way through to mrs hushye i couldn\\'t connect with her we kept around any number of versions of \\'the cherry orchard\\' and never did anything about that either\" she did one chekhov play however \"the three sisters\" in which she brought together judith anderson ruth gordon alexander knox and edmund gwenn it ran for 230 performances in the season of 1942-43 indeed miss cornell was generous in selecting her supporting casts which over the years included marlon brando brian aherne charles boyer grace george tyrone power gregory peck orson welles and laurence olivier diminished dazzle in the fifties toward the end of her career miss cornell seemed to many observers to have a diminished dazzle \"the dark is light enough\" \"the first born\" and \"dear liar\" did not draw the oohs and aahs of her previous plays the actress was reluctant to appear on radio or television she did act for them but they were not her media for years miss cornell and her husband lived in a house on beekman place then in 1951 they moved to sneden landing ny and after mr mcclintic death she gave up that house for a summer place on martha vineyard and a small house in new york for her acting and her contributions to the stage the actress received dozens of awards and honorary degrees a room at the new york public library theater collection at lincoln center was dedicated to her and her husband and she was given the national artists award of the american national theater and academy a gold medal on which ironically her first name was spelled \"katherine\" the citation was less in error for it lauded her \"incomparable acting ability and her theatrical genius\" and said that she had \"elevated the theater throughout the world\"',\n",
       " 'thomas j watson sr who built the fabulous international business machines corporation died of a heart attack yesterday in roosevelt hospital he was 82 years old and had been hospitalized since sunday often called \"the world greatest salesman\" mr watson was the company board chairman at his death on may 8 he had turned over the post of chief executive officer to his son thomas j

office is at 807 united nations plaza mr watson had been living at his summer home 88 weed street new canaan conn where he was stricken over the week-end present when he died were his wife and their four children mr watson was of that breed of capitalists to whom the accumulation of huge personal fortune and the building of a vast business empire became opportunities for the spreading of huge personal benefactions and the accomplishment of widespread public service to a great extent the international business machines corporation is a reflection of the character of the man who led it to a position of eminence among the business machine manufacturers of the world from the slogans that adorn its walls in eighty nations and the expenditures made form its treasury for good works to the methods by which it introduces recruits to what may be called the ibm way of life the company is the creature of the man who commanded it for forty-two years his was a time not so much of smoothly efficient colorless corporate management as of intensely personal direction mr watson led ibm from an uncertain amalgam of smaller companies to a position so akin to a monopoly that competitors and government antitrust officials haled it into court it would have cost $2750 to buy 100 shares of the company stock in 1914 the year mr watson took over anyone exercising rights accruing to those shares through 1925 would have increased his cash investment to $6364 for 153 shares such a person would now hold 3990 shares and would have obtained a value of $2164000 based on market prices this year and cash dividends of $209000 paid thus far mr watson own first earnings were $6 a week his ibm compensation based on salary and percentage of net profits climbed to a government-announced $546294 in 1940 it was surpassed that year only by the $704425 received by louis b mayer motion-picture producer during world war ii in 1942 mr watson chose to forego compensation on his company profits from war contracts in 1943 the company reported that federal and state income taxes combined had exceeded his $427349 compensation that year his 1955 earnings were $346590 optimistic in outlook the clouds of doom never gathered on mr watson horizon habitually he saw nothing but the best of days ahead in the early days of the depression he kept his plants going and added to his sales force even during that era darkest hours he refused to lay off factory help instead he piled up a massive inventory of parts for which there was no immediate use today ibm electronic computers come off assembly lines in six united states cities and plants are being built in two others the company has 200 offices throughout the country it operates factories also in brazil canada england france germany italy japan the netherlands scotland and sweden and assembly plants in argentina australia belgium norway and switzerland the company has 60000 employes its gross assets last year were reported as $629510998 and its 1955 net income after taxes reached a record total of $55872633 mr watson was a tall dignified man whose impeccable ascetic appearance failed to suggest the variety of his interests his activities included education the arts opera sailing and horseback riding he was born feb 17 1874 in campbell n y a small steuben county community not far from the pennsylvania line his parents wanted him to become a lawyer and his father a lumber dealer offered to send him to college although he was later to be honored with doctorates from many colleges and universities mr watson cut short his formal education after a course in the elmira school of commerce at painted post n y he took a selling job in a store that carried sewing machines pianos and organs he moved on to the national cash register company and rose to the post of general sales manager it was during this period that he coined and adopted the motto \"think\" he and his associates were working on advertising material but could not seem to make it sufficiently effective to stimulate himself and others mr watson had a \"think\" sign made-- the first of thousands--and hung it in the conference room slogan always in sight john h patterson head of the company was so impressed with it that he ordered copies for every office in his organization later mr watson made it possible for ibm employes to gaze in almost any direction without losing sight of the admonition to \"think\" his first job with the national cash register company was an itinerant salesman mr watson was no smashing success and after ten days on the road during which he had not sold a machine he returned for a talk with his sales supervisor the supervisor administered a pep talk littered with homilies of the kind that football coaches find useful between the halves the effect of this conference was such that mr watson was ever afterward a champion of the catchword and of the idea that one of the chief duties of a supervisor is the encouragement of those below him mr watson personal rise started when on may 1 1914 he assumed the presidency of the computing-tabulating-recording company this concern had been incorporated in june 1911 the computing-tabulating-recording company was a small organization when he took over with fewer than 400 employes its products were a punch-card tabulator which had been invented in time for use in the 1890 census; time clocks and other business machines in february 1924 the company was merged with the international business machines corporation and assumed its name in talks to employes at endicott n y and later at other installations mr watson quickly set about expounding his ideas industrial \\'family\\' concept he developed the concept of the industrial \"family\" whose duties were first to the customer who must receive good value for his money; next to the members of the \"family\" who must receive proper compensation; and then to the owners of the corporation who must receive profits for the customer mr watson saw to it that new machines were devised to meet new needs and new needs were discovered to stimulate the sale of new and old machines one of his proudest \"selling\" jobs was the negotiation of a $40000 loan without the customary collateral from the guaranty trust company of new york--of which he later became a director most of the borrowed funds were used for the establishment of an engineering laboratory for the development of new machines greatly enlarged the corporation laboratories have contributed to the ibm catalogue which includes computers machines for simultaneously weighing and counting items translators for the simultaneous broadcast of a speech in several languages intricate calculating machines and other scientific specialties under mr watson management the company long had retained ownership of its machines making them available under a system of annual rentals in 1952 the government started a civil antitrust suit against ibm charging that the corporation owned more than 90 per cent of all tabulating machines used in the united states its rentals were estimated at $100000000 annually the annual rental was estimated by government lawyers to have amounted to $250000000 before a consent decree was signed in federal court here last jan 25 under this decree the company agreed to offer its machines for sale to set up a separate company to service machines to supply parts and data to other companies servicing equipment and to release its patents for licensing mr watson wide civic activities ranged from the presidency of the old merchants association here to host for city celebrations for kings presidents and dignitaries of many descriptions in the international area his slogan

pianist though trained as a concert pianist mr adams decided in 1930 that his true vocation was photography two years later he was accomplished enough to be given a one-man show at the m h de young museum in san francisco and the same year he joined edward weston and imogen cunningham in forming the short-lived ''group f/64'' in the words of mr adams friend wallace stegner the founding of this

newhall said later ''taos was his paris and his rome'' his first book ''taos pueblo'' with a text by mary austin came out in 1930 precision and sharp focus were fundamental to good photography as mr

and seminars in the yosemite valley he taught and lectured at the museum of modern art and colleges all along the pacific coast and he published his work in portfolio form as his reputation grew he

parks and monuments in alaska hawaii and elsewhere in many writings in the postwar period he stressed the importance of vision as distinct from gadgetry ''a picture'' he liked to say ''is only a collection of brightnesses'' and he would add ''there is nothing worse than a brilliant image of a fuzzy concept'' fellow of american academy films about mr adams and his work were directed by david myers in 1957 and by robert katz in 1959 in 1963 mrs newhall published a study of him called ''the eloquent light'' after the show of that name that mr adams had just had at the de young museum in san

       " \"andres segovia the master guitarist who was one of the paramount concert artists of this century died of a heart attack tuesday in madrid he was 94 years old on april 8 three days before a scheduled recital at carnegie hall the spanish musician was admitted to cabrini hospital in new york city because of ''heart irregularities'' the remainder of his united states tour was canceled a pacemaker was implanted and he was flown home to spain segovia was a pivotal figure whose crusade in behalf of the classic guitar left an imprint on musical history parental objections when he took up the guitar over bitter parental objections in his native village of linares in southern spain the instrument had fallen into neglect and disrepute long before his death the spanish musician had seen the guitar placed on the curriculum of the major music schools and conservatories and had become an idol to millions who took up the instrument as performers concertgoers or record collectors in his furtherance of his chosen instrument segovia can be fairly compared to such similarly influential performers as paganini violin liszt piano casals cello and landowska harpsichord as they did segovia left his instrument richer in technique in repertory and in public esteem his life goals the guitarist himself summed up his life goals in an interview with the new york times when he was 75 years old: ''first to redeem my guitar from the flamenco and all those other things second to create a repertory - you know that almost all the good composers of our time have written works for the guitar through me and even for my pupils third i wanted to create a public for the guitar now i fill the biggest halls in all the countries and at least a third of the audience is young - i am very glad to steal them from the beatles fourth i was determined to win the guitar a respected place in the great music schools along with the piano the violin and other concert instruments'' although reference books differ as to his birthdate segovia gave it as feb 21 1893 his father a lawyer wanted the boy to follow a career in law and was horrified to find that at an early age his son had fallen in love with the guitar piano and cello lessons were unsuccessful in diverting him from the traditional spanish instrument his father the musician liked to recall in later years broke ''two or three'' guitars before giving up the attempt to discourage his son affection for an instrument regarded at that time as fit to be played only in cafes by gypsies the guitar however had a little-recognized tradition that was separate from flamenco and other popular and folk idioms segovia over the objections of teachers at the granada institute of music where he was sent to study set out to rediscover the guitar classic past unable to find a teacher he guided himself and would say in later years with a smile ''to this day teacher and pupil have never had a serious quarrel'' basing his technical study chiefly on his own intuitions and what he could learn of the methods of the 19th-century guitar virtuoso and teacher francisco tarrega segovia quickly developed into a dazzling technician and consummate musician he made his debut in granada in 1909 at age 16 and soon became known throughout spain at the age of 22 he appeared in a recital at the paris conservatory and his success resulted in a concert tour of south america by the time he returned to europe in 1923 there was a public waiting eagerly to hear him his official paris debut in 1924 attended by the city musical elite created a sensation at that time few had heard bach played on the guitar and segovia performances of his own bach transcriptions were revelations of his talent and the instrument potential expanding the repertory leading 20th-century composers most of them close friends of segovia wrote for his instrument roussel ibert falla villa-lobos casella castelnuovo-tedesco poulenc britten ponce turina rodrigo moreno torroba berkeley arnold henze martin walton hindemith rawsthorne and bennett are some who wrote pieces either for segovia or for his disciples such as the englishman julian bream and the australian john williams segovia encouraged the writing of concertos for guitar as well as solo works and performed these concertos with many of the world great symphony orchestras his own transcriptions fleshed out the solo repertory and today constitute a large part of the music available to the classic guitarist new york first heard segovia on jan 8 1928 when he gave a recital at town hall that included music by bach haydn sor and tarrega in a review of the debut in the new york times olin downes described the already famous 34-year-old guitarist this way: ''the appearance of mr segovia is not that of the trumpeted virtuoso he is rather the dreamer or scholar in bearing long hair eyeglasses a black frock coat and neckwear of an earlier generation'' the reviewer astonished by the variety of tone colors and the expressive effects that segovia could call out of his soft-voiced instrument added this judgment: ''he belongs to the very small group of musicians who by transcendental power of execution by imagination and intuition create an art of their own that sometimes seems to transform the very nature of their medium'' the 'segovia hush' although his new york recitals were given for years in such relatively intimate places as town hall segovia moved in the 1960 to carnegie hall and to philharmonic hall now avery fisher hall some of his dedicated followers deplored this decision but segovia art proved able to communicate to audiences of several thousand the phenomenon known as the ''segovia hush'' fell over any hall in which the aging artist appeared and he was proud of his ability to hold large audiences in breathless silence he also could grow impatient when on occasion a few persistent coughers and program-rustlers proved immune to his magic at such times he would frown over his thick glasses he underwent detached-retina surgery in the late 1960 or take out his handkerchief cover his mouth and cough soundlessly into it to offer a hint to the insensitive recordings played a large role in segovia success he said late in life that his first record made in london for hmv 'ometime around 1926'' still paid him an occasional small royalty in fact few segovia records stayed out of print: more than a dozen could be found in the catalogues at any time during the last 20 years of his life in this country his records appeared chiefly on the decca label for years and more recently under the imprint of mca decca successor and rca an invariable triumph among the dozens of memorable works in his recorded repertory are his transcriptions of bach lute music and works for violin and cello; his transcriptions of lute suites by sylvius leopold weiss; concertos by castelnuovo-tedesco villa-lobos and ponce; transcriptions of piano pieces by granados and albeniz and guitar works by sor tarrega moreno-torroba roussel castelnuovo-tedesco tansman and turina one of his invariable triumphs over the years was bach chaconne which he contended had originally been written for lute or guitar rather than unaccompanied violin many musicians who disagreed with that idea still found his performances amazingly persuasive in their harmonic richness and contrapuntal clarity segovia american career had been started in 1928 when fritz kreisler the viennese violinist urged f c coppicus of the metropolitan musical bureau to present the guitarist in new york after more than a decade of success segovia broke off his tours in the united states because of the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936 he left his home in spain and lived for a time in genoa italy and in montevideo uruguay he toured central and south america during this period but did not return to the united states until 1943 when the impresario sol hurok undertook to rebuild his popularity often by guaranteeing local managers against loss before long the name andres segovia was in an elite bracket along with such box-office stars as rubinstein heifetz and horowitz casals arranged paris debut unlike his countryman pablo casals who refused for many years to return to spain in protest against the franco regime segovia adopted an aloofness from politics for some years he lived in new york city in an upper east side apartment as well as in switzerland but he regularly returned to play in spain ''i need to touch the earth of my homeland periodically to receive new energy'' he said segovia relations with casals were once warm: it was the cellist already a renowned musician who arranged for the young guitarist formal debut in paris in april 1924 a famous event whose audience included such artists as manuel de falla and paul dukas they came to hear the unknown spaniard largely at the insistence of casals however segovia lost the friendship of the catalan cellist during the spanish civil war by refusing to cut himself off from his native country which he continued to visit throughout the franco regime unlike casals he returned there to live after world war ii his rationale being that he loved his country too much to abandon it for the sake of a political gesture teaching to the end in recent decades segovia conducted master classes in the guitar at santiago de compostela in spain as well as in music schools and universities all over the world this march he conducted such classes at the manhattan school of music and at carnegie hall he also taught for many years in siena italy at the accademia chigiana a music school housed in a villa owned by his friend prince chigi study with segovia became a virtual necessity for aspiring guitar virtuosos and came to be regarded as a seal of approval internationally his students included julian bream john williams christopher parkening alirio diaz oscar ghiglia and dozens more segovia first marriage ended in divorce in 1951 in 1961 he married a 22-year-old guitarist emilia corral sancho a student of his their son carlos andres now 17 was born when segovia was 77 years old a son andres and a daughter beatrice by his first wife were born more than half a century before carlos andres he once told an interviewer ''i am more celebrated for being a father than an artist'' segovia built a home for his new family on a hilltop in southern spain between malaga and granada and in his last active years severely reduced his concert activity cutting back to some two dozen recitals a season from the 100-odd appearances he made each year until he was well into his 70 he is survived by his wife and two sons andres and carlos andres artist with words too a gracious old worldly man with a liking for poetic language andres segovia was a fount of picturesquely phrased wisdom and comment here are some examples on the value of hard work: i practice only five hours a day no more work is necessary and a pleasure it is like those old paintings of jacob ladder with angels climbing up and down rung by rung - although they have wings on young conductors: for most of them the academy has been the mirror and the gramophone on the power of the guitar to be heard in large halls:> my friend who is a philosopher was speaking to students in a great hall and one said he could not hear 'very well' said the philosopher ''i will speak lower'' on the cost of his guitar: a guitar has value but no price on modern music: unfortunately i think music is declining all art is in need of redemption on flamenco guitarists: i like very much the true flamenco which is played with heavy fingers roughly but from the soul but flamenco has departed from the good simple tradition the flamencos should not be professionals on his hatred of routine playing: i have to be present at every note i play on his wife emilia: she was my pupil for 12 years before she became my master on continuing a heavy schedule into old age: i will have an eternity to rest\",\n",

hold the line until that moment perhaps two years away when new battleships could be ready with adm ernest king chief of naval operations president roosevelt and the navy other strategy planners

not overly enthusiastic at his first experience with the sea \"i got frightfully seasick and must confess to some chilling of enthusiasm for the sea\" he said ensign nimitz was a handsome self-assured young officer who saw to it that he knew the technical phases of his profession in his early days in the navy he commanded an assortment of obsolete minor vessels and was much pleased when he received command of the old destroyer stephen decatur during a storm the engineer of the destroyer telephoned from the engine room that the vessel was taking on water rapidly and soon would sink lieutenant nimitz replied soothingly: \"just look on page 84 of \\'barton engineering manual\\' it will tell you what to do\" the vessel was saved won life saving medal in 1912 lieutenant nimitz was awarded the navy silver life saving medal for saving a shipmate from drowning he wore this medal throughout the remainder of his career along with the five distinguished service medal awards for wartime exploits

two submitted for the post of commander in chief of the pacific fleet the other was that of adm husband e kimmel who got the assignment admiral nimitz was in his home in washington listening to a symphony on the radio when he heard the news that pearl harbor had been attacked he picked up his hat and went down to the office of the chief of naval operations for orders a few days later admiral kimmel was relieved and admiral nimitz was on his way to pearl harbor went to post as civilian admiral nimitz made the train trip to the west coast in civilian clothes under an assumed name mrs nimitz missed her sewing bag and it was not until many months later that she learned that her husband had used it to carry secret documents dealing with the extent of damage to the fleet in the pearl harbor attack the 65 million square miles of the pacific became well known to admiral nimitz as he contemplated the operations charts that were to carry the story of defeat and victory in the next few years while waiting for united states yards to turn out the ships he needed admiral nimitz built up his combat teams these were commanded by admirals william f halsey mare a mitschner richmond k turner raymond a spruance and thomas c kincaid admiral nimitz handled these complex men with skill and insight as he did everyone he flew to australia to call on general of the army douglas macarthur to avoid any protocol friction once when a sailor from texas dropped in on him at pacific fleet headquarters to chat admiral nimitz sent for a navy photographer to take a picture \"it seems that his shipmates bet him $20 he wouldn\\'t get to see me\" the admiral explained \"i wanted him to have the evidence\" when he took over command of the pacific fleet admiral nimitz was quick to see that a great weakness lay in the lack of forward repair stations and maintenance squadrons when those squadrons came into being at his insistence the navy was prepared to take the fight to the japanese the first major pacific naval battle after pearl harbor came on may 8 1942 in the coral sea this was the world first naval battle fought entirely in the air without the carriers even sighting each other or a shot being exchanged between surface vessels it was adjudged an american success although the japanese shot down many united states planes battle saved australia the aircraft carrier lexington was lost to japanese bombs but the coral sea victory saved australia and new zealand from invasion a later victory at midway removed the japanese navy as an immediate threat to hawaii the panama canal and the united states during the first half of 1944 admiral nimitz employed the main fighting strength of the pacific navy in the central pacific the bloody victory at tarawa was followed by the \"great turkey shoot\" in the marianas where united states aviators downed 402 out of 545 japanese planes sighted at his headquarters at pearl harbor admiral nimitz set an example to his staff by

       " 'for six years john foster dulles dominated both the making and the conduct of united states foreign policy in the realm of foreign affairs he was president eisenhower chief adviser his chief representative on capitol hill and his chief agent and negotiator at home and abroad mr dulles was a highly controversial secretary of state those who followed his career were rarely dispassionate; they divided usually between ardent admirers and those who disliked or distrusted him certain things however were incontestable first was the extent of his role he was undoubtedly the strongest personality of the eisenhower cabinet and as such he constantly played a leading role in washington and often in the councils of the western alliance secondly whatever his qualities as a policy-maker he had few peers as an advocate no one could equal him as a persuader in the white house councils in facing the senate foreign relations committee he sometimes encountered criticism and skepticism but he inevitably had his way thirdly he had extraordinary vitality he maintained personal contacts and sought to exercise american leadership by constant travel in all parts of the world as secretary he flew a total of 479286 miles outside the united states successful lawyer and a moralist mr dulles was a man of complex character full of paradoxes a shrewd and successful corporation lawyer he was also a moralist and political philosopher he could marshal his ideas swiftly fluently and extemporaneously; he coined many phrases but he was not noted as an originator of new ideas he was gregarious but he worked alone to the despair of his state department staff gracious in private he was often awkward in public yet he held news conferences more regularly than any other member of president eisenhower cabinet handsome as a young man mr dulles in later years assumed the characteristics of a stern church elder when in repose the corners of his mouth drooped in an expression of extreme gravity that some observers have related to his strict presbyterian upbringing but this expression was relieved by frequent broad smiles his physique as displayed on the occasions when he took time for a swim was impressive he was muscular lean with powerful shoulders the result of much swimming boating and fishing during boyhood this physical equipment made it possible for him to put in eleven-hour working days in washington and then go on to his evening social obligations it also enabled him when traveling to transform his airplane into an office so that after a grueling flight he was ready for the conference table cabin in ontario was his retreat part of mr dulles\\' secret was his ability to relax during negotiations he would be seen slumped in his chair doodling or sharpening pencils seemingly without a care in the world mr dulles also knew the virtue of \"getting away\" for five-day breaks at his log cabin retreat on duck island in lake ontario in 1941 he bought this tiny island where the only other inhabitants were a lighthouse warden and radio operator he and his wife janet discovered and fell in love with it during their many summer sailing expeditions in the great lakes they liked to withdraw to the privacy of their island and rough it hauling water chopping wood fishing and cooking mr dulles took pride in his cooking especially fish in washington the dulleses lived comfortably in a spacious stone house on a wooded hillside ten minutes from the state department offices this was their choice prosperous years as a corporation lawyer--the best paid in the history of new york city according to some accounts-- had left him financially independent the dulles family never suffered particularly for lack of money john watson foster mr dulles\\' grandfather saw to that born in a log cabin in indiana he became a brigadier general in the civil war united states minister to mexico and russia and secretary of state under president benjamin harrison he amassed his fortune as a successful lawyer this grandfather in whose washington home he was born on feb 25 1888 and who started him on his legal and diplomatic career was the greatest formative influence in mr dulles\\' life grandfather foster however was only a part of an active and rich family life that produced two other notable personalities--one is mr dulles\\' younger brother allen w director of the central intelligence agency the other his younger sister eleanor joined the state department before her brother got there and is at present the officer in charge of berlin in the office of german affairs the dulles family says it can trace its ancestry to charlemagne that it does not take this too seriously however is indicated by the fact that mrs dulles named her french poodle \"pepi\" after pepin le bref charlemagne father mr dulles\\' father was the rev allen macy dulles pastor of the first presbyterian church at watertown n y a liberal clergyman he questioned whether belief in the virgin birth was essential to being a christian and he married divorced persons of his children he required rigorous and intensive religious life involving attendance at church three or four times a week and memorization of long passages from the bible enjoyed swimming fishing and sailing much of this stayed with mr dulles throughout his life he was always ready with a quotation from two books and kept them within reach at home and at the office: the bible and the federalist they represented respectively the religious influence of his father and the political influence of his grandfather over the dinner table the dulles children heard talk of morality and diplomacy sometimes \"uncle bert\"--robert lansing later secretary of state under president woodrow wilson--was there grandfather foster would argue the case for the boers and uncle bert the case for the british in the boer war the family was fond of boating when foster was 13 after a bad case of typhoid fever his grandfather presented him a twelve-foot st lawrence cat boat from then on sailing fishing and swimming were his greatest pleasures for the rest of his life in all kinds of weather he took every opportunity to cruise lake ontario the st lawrence the coasts of nova scotia maine and long island the rev mr dulles had a private income to supplement his pastor stipend so the family could afford some summers in europe these were spent at left bank hotels in paris and bicycling through the lowlands and germany john foster dulles learned good french some german and passable spanish after grammar school and high school at watertown foster went to princeton university at that time he expected to follow his father into the ministry and concentrated on the study of philosophy but an invitation to accompany grandfather foster in the summer of 1907 to the second hague peace conference began to turn his interests toward diplomacy foster was then 19 his grandfather who acted as delegate for the imperial government of china got him a job as a secretary to the chinese delegation on the strength of his knowledge of french foster was graduated from princeton in 1908 as valedictorian of his class with a phi beta kappa key and a $600 scholarship for a year study at the sorbonne in paris by the end of that year he had made up his mind to study law rather than theology to be able to live with his grandfather he decided to study at george washington university in washington through his grandfather he was drawn into a gay social life but managed at the same time to absorb three years of law studies in two years with the highest grades ever achieved at the university received law degree 25 years late because he had been in attendance only two years instead of three the university declined to give him a degree it did so twenty-five years later but the young mr dulles passed the new york state bar examinations and moved on to new york city in search of a job to his chagrin he discovered that the big law firms on whose doors he knocked were not interested in graduates from george washington university much less one who had not even received a degree harvard and columbia law school it seemed were the \"right\" places to study law it took a letter from grandfather foster to william nelson cromwell senior partner of the firm of sullivan & cromwell to win the young man a chance to start--at $50 a month on june 26 1912 he and janet avery of auburn ny were married at auburn he then had a salary of $100 a month but grandfather foster made it possible for the newlyweds to live fairly comfortably the income of foster dulles the young lawyer grew steadily as he distinguished himself in assignment after assignment usually in the international field rejected for military service during world war i because of poor eyesight mr dulles got an army commission as captain in the war industries board this in turn led to his being sent to the versailles peace conference to deal with reparations questions at the age of 31 mr dulles made a preliminary mark as a junior diplomat by clearly and forcefully arguing against imposing crushing reparations on germany president wilson wrote a personal letter asking him to stay on in europe after the conference to handle reparations questions the fact that he was one of five men--another was thomas w lamont a partner in j p morgan--who served as the president economic advisers at versailles gave john foster dulles\\' career another lift he became a partner in sullivan & cromwell with a substantially enhanced income one international assignment followed another--to norway denmark poland uruguay chile and other lands usually mrs dulles accompanied him on his trips abroad in 1937 mr dulles tried to hire as a trial lawyer for his firm a young man named thomas e dewey who was winning a reputation as prosecutor of underworld characters mr dewey agreed but changed his mind and ran instead for election as district attorney thus began a long political association between mr dulles and mr dewey in 1939 mr dulles joined george z medalie a republican lawyer and roger w straus chairman of american smelting and refining company in planning mr dewey strategy in seeking the presidential nomination mr dewy lost to wendell l willkie in 1940 but in 1944 he won the nomination and john foster dulles stepped in as his foreign policy adviser in this capacity mr dulles was maneuvered into a conference with cordell hull then secretary of state on the formation of the united nations this led to a bipartisan approach to the united nations issue and to the appointment of mr dulles as a senior united states adviser at the san francisco conference of the united nations in 1945 mr dulles\\' stature in international affairs was established by his work at the san francisco conference mr dewey again sought the presidency in 1948 and mr dulles was again his advisor on foreign affairs it was generally believed that mr dulles would have been secretary of state if mr dewey had won but harry s truman was the surprise victor mr dulles was a member of the united states delegation to the united nations general assembly in paris in november 1948 when secretary of state george c marshall was forced to return to the united states for surgery president truman named mr dulles acting chairman of the delegation he was with secretary of state dean acheson at the big four foreign ministers\\' conference in paris in 1949 on july 7 of that year governor dewey named him to the united states senate in an interim appointment to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of senator robert f wagner campaigning on a platform critical of the fair deal of president truman mr dulles sought election to the senate in a special election in november 1949 his opponent was former gov herbert h lehman mr dulles was defeated by 196293 votes--2573934 to 2377641 in april 1951 when president truman removed general of the army douglas macarthur from his far east commands during the korean fighting mr truman sent mr dulles to tokyo to assure the japanese government that general macarthur departure signified no important change in united states policy in the far east that there should be no misunderstanding on this point was of special importance to mr dulles who was engaged on his last and biggest job for president truman--concluding a peace treaty with japan this was a task that mr dulles had sought he had urged secretary acheson that the only way to get the long-delayed treaty was to pick one trusted man and give him a year full-time to work it out mr dulles got the job treaty with japan was his handiwork during the next twelve months he flew 125000 miles between washington and tokyo and from capital to capital resolving differences lining up support for a \"peace of reconciliation\" with japan on sept 8 1951 just a year after mr dulles got his assignment the treaty was signed at san francisco surveying mr dulles\\' handiwork state department officials admiringly paid tribute to a \"master craftsman\" during the presidential campaign of 1952 mr dulles forgot bipartisanship the vitriolic assault on democratic foreign policy he wrote for the republican party platform caused critics to tax him for the first time--but not the last--with acting more like a corporation lawyer serving his client than a statesman after the election mr dulles was one of the first men president eisenhower named to his cabinet the job of secretary of state was one that he apparently had been after for a long time certainly he had had it in mind when he involved himself in the presidential campaigns of 1940 1944 and 1948 but when he had it in his grasp he was said to have had doubts he realized that what he wanted was the foreign-policy function and that as secretary of state he would be burdened with many other tasks as well he is said to have remarked that what he would really have liked was a quiet office in the white house as foreign-policy consultant far from the cumbersome machinery of the state department yet there was never any question about mr dulles\\' conviction that he with experience in foreign affairs dating to the hague conference of 1907 with a rich family background of diplomacy was the man best qualified to call the turns of united states foreign policy he had it all in his head he did not need the ambassadorial analyses and the studies of the policy planning staff and the host of departmental experts he had a big yellow pad at his bedside and he jotted down thoughts as they occurred to him thus were born the phrases around which united states foreign policy revolved for nearly seven years for example during his campaign speeches in 1952 mr dulles maintained that the democratic party policy of \"containment\" must be replaced by a policy of \"liberation\" what united states foreign policy needed he said was more \"heart\" president eisenhower put these thoughts into practice by withdrawing the seventh fleet from the formosa strait thereby \"unleashing\" president chiang kai-shek of nationalist china for action against the mainland for a time undercover operations in the far east and in eastern europe were somewhat stimulated but when the tests came in the anti-communist berlin riots in 1953 the french call for help at dienbienphu in 1954 the chinese communist threat to quemoy in 1954-55 the hungarian rising against the russians in 1956 the united states did not act as things worked out there was a wide margin between mr dulles\\' bold words and the united states government actions although mr dulles never specifically confirmed it there is good reason to believe that during the month of july 1954 he and admiral arthur h radford twice tried to get the british to agree to a united states air strike with planes based on carriers and in the philippines against the communist forces attacking dienbienphu a key french stronghold in the north of indochina but the british would not go along as mr dulles might have expected the plan was abandoned and dienbienphu was lost seato filled gap in asian defense in public mr dulles spoke only of the need for \"united action\" by the western allies and their friends in asia to oppose the communists and this in the end led to the formation of the southeast asia treaty organization at manila on sept 8 1954 embracing pakistan thailand and the philippines in addition to the united states britain france australia and new zealand seato went far toward closing the gaps in the world-wide network of military alliances gaps that were a constant subject of concern to mr dulles the philosophy behind mr dulles\\' maneuverings concerning dienbienphu and other crises was spelled out in an article that he apparently inspired in life magazine on jan 16 1956 it contained the definition of what some have called \"brinkmanship\": \"the ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art\" and he explained that his skill in doing just that had ended the korean war with an implied threat to drop atomic bombs on manchuria had restrained the communist chinese from sending their forces into indochina with a show of force by two aircraft carriers and an invitation to allied nations to form a \"united front\" and had headed off communist invasion of quemoy with the bipartisan formosa resolution authorizing armed united states intervention an important part of mr dulles\\' \"brinkmanship\" was \"massive retaliation\" the boldest of all his phrases he said in a speech on jan 12 1954 that the president and national security council had decided \"to depend primarily upon a great capacity to retaliate instantly by means and at places of our own choosing\" the storm aroused by these words obliged mr dulles to explain later that of course the punishment must always suit the crime that he was not talking about indiscriminate bombing of moscow there were some other phrases that symbolized his tenure addressing state department employes on his first day in office mr dulles called for \"positive loyalty\" he also said on another occasion: \"i\\'m not going to be caught with another alger hiss on my hands\" as result of this attitude he tolerated for several years the operations of walter scott mcleod a former agent of the federal bureau of investigation and later a member of the staff of styles bridges republican senator from new hampshire mr dulles\\' administrative under secretary hired mr mcleod as security chief when the cases of jon carter vincent and john paton davies state department career men came up for review mr dulles found nothing in their records showing lack of loyalty but he retired them anyway on the ground that they had become burdensome and that a secretary of state could not afford to carry excess baggage under this doctrine no foreign service officer could be sure that if he were falsely accused of disloyalty he would be backed up by his boss \\'reappraisal\\' talk distressed french still another phrase was born on dec 14 1953 when mr dulles said in paris that if the french assembly did not approve the european defense community treaty \"that would compel an agonizing reappraisal\" of basic united states foreign policy the surprising thing about this statement was that after spending so many months in france mr dulles did not realize that among sensitive frenchmen his words would boomerang and almost guaranteed the defeat of the defense community mr dulles flew to caracas venezuela on march 28 1954 for a pan american conference he was largely responsible for the adoption of an anti-communist resolution by which american republics pledged \"countermeasures\" to prevent communist control of any american state getting the resolution adopted was a victory of a kind for mr dulles but many of the latin americans resented the pressure brought by the united states on behalf of the resolution the phrase \"open skies\"--mutual freedom to engage in aerial inspection--was not coined by mr dulles however mr dulles picked up the \"open skies\" proposal that president eisenhower made to the russians at the summit conference of 1955 and used it to underline the essentiality of mutual inspection during long and inconclusive negotiations on all aspects of disarmament always the talks broke down on the inspection issue at iowa state college on june 9 1955 mr dulles said \"neutrality has increasingly become an obsolete and except under very exceptional circumstances it is an immoral and shortsighted conception\" india and many other nations with neutralist tendencies in the afro-asian world took this as a gratuitous affront later mr dulles conceded that neutrals of the immoral kind were \"very few\" in number and toward the end of his period in office he acquired a growing appreciation of the value of genuine neutrality indians were also offended by an illusion to \"portuguese provinces in the far east\" meaning goa a portuguese-owned territory on the coast of india mr dulles permitted the phrase to appear in a joint statement with portugal minister of foreign affairs on dec 2 1955 mr dulles considered himself an expert on the soviet union more often than on other topics he would make declarations about the soviet without consulting his state department aides particularly striking and particularly criticized were his assertions of soviet weakness on feb 24 1956 he told the senate foreign relations committee that \"at this moment in moscow they are having to revise their whole program they have failed\" mr dulles felt at home talking about europe and the soviet union but he was much less at ease when dealing with the middle east it is possible nonetheless that the concept of a \"northern tier of defense\" against the soviet union in the middle east may have been his most original single contribution to foreign policy originally intended as an association of the nations in the area which the great powers would back but not join the concept was radically changed by the british who encouraged and joined the \"baghdad pact\" still another foreign-policy concept the eisenhower doctrine proclaimed by both houses of congress on march 9 1957 was really the dulles doctrine mr dulles conceived and defended this resolution before congress asserting that the president was prepared to use armed force to support any middle eastern country that asked for help against communist aggression conceived doctrine for the mideast mr dulles did not succeed in preserving the momentary goodwill of the arabs that had been generated by united states opposition to british-french-israeli operations against egypt in the fall of 1956 by the spring of 1958 the united states found itself sharply opposed to president gamal abdel nasser penetration of lebanon once again mr dulles had a phrase for it: \"indirect aggression\" when revolution flared in iraq in 1958 mr dulles countered \"indirect aggression\" by the united arab republic with landings by united states forces in lebanon mr dulles will be remembered for his part in leading the republican party out of its long tradition of isolationism into a new era of internationalism often criticized during his tenure for seeming inflexibility in his dealings with the soviet union there was growing appreciation during his last months in office that his line was basically sound he achieved his objectives best in europe in spite of the rebuff he suffered on the issue of the european defense community with mr dulles\\' encouragement west germany regained sovereignty as a member of the north atlantic alliance while at the same time progressively closing economic ranks with france in the far east he stood inflexibly attached to alliance with nationalist china and opposed to recognition of communist china with united states help president chiang kai-shek was able to hold the islands of quemoy and matsu in spite of heavy communist bombardment chiang reinforced offshore islands disregarding mr dulles\\' advice chiang retained the heavy manpower commitment to these islands through which in another crisis the united states could be drawn into war in the middle east he lost heavily by not making it possible for egypt to acquire arms in the united states he opened the way for a soviet-egyptian arms deal that carried soviet influence into the heart of the middle east by dramatically withdrawing united states support for the aswan high dam in egypt he provoked president nasser seizure of the suez canal company which led to an abortive british-french invasion of the canal zone and further deterioration of western prestige by sending troops into lebanon on the heels of the iraqi revolution he convinced the iraqi revolutionaries that the united states might oppose them by force they turned to the soviet union for help mr dulles\\' personal skill as a negotiator made him look almost indispensable time after time he mixed the diplomatic glue with which differences among the allies were papered over mr dulles believed that to spend too much time in washington would be to neglect his higher duties as leader in the western alliance nevertheless his absences led to neglect of his administrative tasks and made it impossible for him to make full use of the state department and the foreign service as diplomatic tools after the crisis on the european defense community the french called him brutal after the suez crisis the british accused him of double-dealing after his remarks on goa and neutrality the indians tended to write him off but when mr dulles had to withdraw from the international scene one word was heard over and over among the diplomats of europe and asia: \"indispensable\" when president eisenhower announced mr dulles\\' resignation he had tears in his eyes the moment was so moving that no one could bring himself to ask a question with mixed pity and consternation some remembered a remark attributed to the president several years ago: \"if anything happened to foster where could i find a man able to replace him\"',\n",

       " 'washington saturday sept 25--retired associate justice hugo l black whose liberal philosophy influenced the supreme court through 34 years of social change died early today he was 85 years old justice black entered bethesda naval hospital on aug 28 and retired sept 17 he suffered a severe stroke just two days later \"justice hugo black died peacefully at 1 a m this morning of inflammation of the arteries and stroke\" the hospital administrative officer said the officer archie stahl said no further details were available immediately to justice black who many observers believe influenced american life more than any of his colleagues in modern time the constitution was his bible a well-thumbed copy was always in his pocket when challenged about the effect of unpopular decisions he would say simply: \"the court didn\\'t do it the constitution did it\" when justice black retired from the supreme court a week ago his 34 years of service were the third longest in the nation history he fought for civil liberties civil rights freedom of the press freedom of religion he argued-- and prevailed time and again--that the 14th amendment required every state to obey every part of the bill of rights devoted to constitution \"where my constitution\" justice black asked ruffling through his pockets and spreading out the papers on his desk \"i always keep my constitution in my coat pocket what could have happened to it have you got one on you\" he asked of a visitor a few years ago \"you ought to keep one on you all the time\" he said buzzing for his secretary \"where my constitution\" the woman searched his desk drawers and scanned the library shelves in the spacious supreme court chambers but found no constitution \"i like to read what it says i like to read the words of the constitution\" justice black said in a slight southern drawl after dispatching the secretary to fetch one \"i\\'m a literalist i admit it it a bad word these days i know but that what i am\" shortly the constitution was delivered hugo lafayette black then 81 years old and completing his 30th year on the united states supreme court laid it tenderly on his lap and opened it to the bill of rights \"now\" he said with a warm smile \"now let see what it says\" perhaps as well as anything else the incident illustrated what formed chief justice earl warren called the \"unflagging devotion\" of mr black to the constitution of the united states perhaps no other man in the history of the court so revered the constitution as a source of the free and good life few articulated so lucidly simply and forcefully a philosophy of the 18th- century document less than a handful had the impact on constitutional law and the quality of the nation as this self-described \"backward country fellow\" from clay county alabama \"i believe that our constitution\" justice black once said \"with its absolute guarantee of individual rights is the best hope for the aspirations of freedom which men share everywhere\" champion of liberties he came to the supreme court from the united states senate vilified as a ku klux klanner after taking his seat in 1937 but he discomfited his critics making his mark as a champion of civil rights and liberties the bill of rights was his holy writ a set of \"absolutes\" erected by the framers to shield and nurture individual freedom of these he considered the first amendment the cornerstone of liberty and freedom of speech as the heart of the first amendment \"my view is without deviation without any ifs buts or whereases that freedom of speech means that you shall not do something to people whether for the views they have or the views they express or the words they speak or write\" he said in a rare news conference in new york in 1962 despite this libertarian affirmation justice black also lived long enough to be accused in the twilight of his career of \"going conservative\" of \"turning his back on the negro\" of inconsistency and even of senility by many old admirers who were shocked and saddened by his positions on civil rights protests poll taxes anti-birth control laws and electronic eavesdropping \\'i haven\\'t changed\\' but justice black denied that there had been a change of direction \"i haven\\'t changed a jot or tittle\" he said in 1967 on another occasion he drew a sharp distinction between speech and many types of civil rights activities just as he viewed his interpretation of the bill of rights as cutting down incursions on personal freedom he also saw the constitution as giving the greatest leeway to government in the economic sphere born poor largely self-educated mr black was a southern liberal his views rooted in the populist-progressive credo of john peter altgeld the elder robert la follette and george w norris a stanch new dealer in the senate mr black supported franklin d roosevelt \"court- packing\" plan designed to overcome the \"nine old men\" a majority of whom were striking down the president anti-depression legislation as the first roosevelt appointee to the supreme court justice black took the position--held throughout his career--that judges had no power to veto legislation or executive action merely because it conflicted with their concepts of right and wrong this theme that courts have no power to dilute or expand constitutional provisions was readily accepted by the new deal supreme court in economic cases and indeed had long been espoused by such justices as oliver wendell holmes louis d brandeis and benjamin n cardozo but in bill of rights cases it caused great consternation first among conservatives then--much later and for far different reasons--among liberals it was a controversial philosophy combining justice black doctrine of \"absolutes\"--that liberties protected by the bill of rights are absolutely insulated from government action--with his view that the 14th amendment forbidding the states to take \"life liberty or property without due process of law\" applied the same protections against state action the bill of rights as written by the founders applied only to the federal government in sum his position was that neither federal nor state action could pass constitutional muster if it collided with the bill of rights and the amendments were to be read with literalness fused with life-giving liberality so as not to dilute their force and effect for more than 20 years justice black jousted fiercely with the dominant so-called \"judicial self- restraint\" wing of the court whose views were that individual rights had to be \"balanced\" against the needs of government the most famous intellectually bloody fights were with justice felix frankfurter particularly during the mccarthy era for most of this time justice black was in dissent but by 1961 the tide had turned and after justice frankfurter retirement in 1962 justice black views virtually prevailed in one case after another justice black dissents were transformed into the law of the land and while the court did not fully accept his application of the entire bill of rights to the states it in fact applied most of their provisions piecemeal during his lifetime these included the right of the indigent to free counsel the sixth amendment; the right to counsel and silence during police interrogation the fifth and sixth amendments; the right of protection against self- incrimination the fifth; the right of confrontation of witnesses the sixth; the fourth amendment protection against illegal searches and seizures and the eighth proscriptions against cruel and unusual punishment and although a majority refused to support his view that the first amendment protected all speech including libel slander and obscenity the rulings in effect did away with most suppression moreover the court accepted justice black long-held view of \"one man one vote\" always bitterly opposed by justice frankfurter who wished to keep out of the \"political thicket\" turning seen in 1960 but by the late nineteen-sixties a number of supreme court observers felt that justice black had turned in a conservative way they cited such opinions of his as one in 1966 in which the court approved the first convictions of negro antisegregation demonstrators; a subsequent dissent in which he held that no group however just their cause had a constitutional right to demonstrate in a public place and a vehement dissent from a 1969 decision in which the court rule that public school officials could not interfere with students\\' rights to express political opinions in a nondisruptive way during school hours justice black was unperturbed by the criticism for in his view he had remained faithful to his principles as he declared in a 1968 television interview: \"i\\'ve never said that freedom of speech gives people the right to tramp up and down the streets by the thousands either saying things that threaten others with real literal language or that threaten them because of the circumstances under which they do it \"the first amendment protects speech and it protects writing and it protects assembly but it doesn\\'t have anything that protects a man right to walk around and around and around my house if he wants to; to fasten my people--my family--up into the house make them afraid to go out of doors afraid that something will happen\" on another occasion he told a colombia law school audience \"i known they\\'re saying [about me] \\'well he used to be all right he was young then but he getting old and mellow and forgetting the ideas he had when he was a young man\\' well i don\\'t think i\\'m old yet and i think i can state categorically that i have not changed my basic constitutional philosophy in at least 40 years\" this was said in 1968 when justice black was 82 at another time in 1967 he declared that he believed \"in a written constitution that limits the power of government all government including the judiciary\" and he added: \"when the judges here begin to say that a thing is so bad it has to be unconstitutional that when i leave \\'em i\\'ve been against poll taxes all my life but they\\'re not unconstitutional i think connecticut anti-birth control law is silly but if a girl can\\'t get an abortion the constitution can\\'t give her one same with eavesdropping i know about all the public furor and i don\\'t favor eavesdroppers but it not forbidden in the constitution\" justice black had occasionally upset liberals in the past by far the biggest shock was his opinion upholding the evacuation of japanese-americans from the west coast in world war ii but for all the contradictions real or superficial--and they were astonishingly few as justices go- -his place is secure and he will stand with the top luminaries of the court--john marshall holmes brandeis one of eight children hugo lafayette black was born feb 27 1886 in a crossroads cabin in the small-farm cotton country of alabama he was the eighth and last child of william lafayette black a onetime volunteer in the confederate army and his wife the former martha ardellah toland his father was a poor farmer who when hugo was 3 bought a general store in nearby ashland a county seat of 350 people a quick energetic boy hugo worked in the weekly newspaper print shop when he was not otherwise busy picking cotton in 1962 when honored by the american jewish congress in new york for his 25th anniversary on the supreme court he recalled his meager beginnings \"seventy years ago when i was a boy\" he said \"perhaps no one who knew me thought i would ever get beyond the confines of the small country county in which i was born there was no reason for them to suspect that i would but we had a free country and the way was open to me\" nor would he forget according to his old friend irving dilliard who edited a volume of his opinions in 1961 the fact that a negro lad he had played with in ashland was killed by a white youth who was acquitted although clearly guilty the country-boy element never completely left him lunching at the basement cafeteria in the supreme court building--he was the only court member to do so regularly--he told a story that illustrated this \"they\\'ve got lots of good restaurants in new york haven\\'t they\" justice black said \"expensive though i remember about 20 years ago a doctor friend took my wife and me to the 23 club--or was it the 21--anyway it was some place must have cost him a fortune he had 50 single dollar bills in his pocket when we walked in and not one left when we walked out and that didn\\'t include the bill! \"well he just kept giving those dollar bills away even the butter boy got one and the salad boy and i\\'m sure the headwaiter got 10 at least well he was a very successful doctor did ear operations \"but even so when he tried to give a dollar to the hat-check girl to retrieve my hat i had to stop him \\'i resent that\\' i told him \\'my wife been trying to get me to throw out that old fedora for 15 years now and nobody going to pay to get it back give the dollar to me\\'\" from medicine to law as a youth hugo black under the influence of his physician brother decided to study medicine but after a year he switched to the university of alabama law school graduating in 1906 he hung up a shingle in ashland but within a year moved to birmingham after a fire had destroyed his office there he handled a variety of work mostly small negligence cases in 1910 he was appointed police court magistrate of birmingham serving for 18 months while at the same time expanding his law practice many years later an expert would occasionally point to justice black police court experience as the reason for his pro-law enforcement interpretations of the fourth amendment he scoffed at this however \"when i was a judge\" he said \"i threw out plenty of applications for warrants i always insisted that the cops have probable cause before i signed one\" it is possible however that his very care made him look more kindly on magistrates afterward for he added \"how much can you review the decision of a magistrate\" more revealing perhaps was his dismissal of disorderly-conduct charges against 22 negroes arrested at a dance the police had stopped magistrate black told the arresting officer that he had \"no more right to break up that dance than any other\" in 1960 writing for a unanimous supreme court justice black reversed the loitering and disorderly-conduct conviction of sam thompson a louisville black who had been arrested and fined $20 by a police court judge for shuffling his feet to jukebox music in a bus-stop cafe three years after leaving the police court hugo black was elected county solicitor or prosecutor of jefferson country in his campaign speeches the young lawyer promised to abolish the fee system whereby sheriffs and jailers were paid a per-diem fee for each prisoner in their custody the system led to trial postponements and mainly affected poor blacks \"the people\" mr black said in his campaign \"are tired of having hundreds of negroes arrested for shooting craps on payday and crowding the jail with these petty offenders\" one of his first acts after taking office was to release 500 prisoners held for undue periods under the fee system investigated brutality more spectacular and more prophetic in terms of mr black career on the supreme court was his investigation of police brutality in bessemer noting an inordinate number of confessions particularly from blacks the prosecutor convened a grand jury and presented evidence of vicious third-degree methods including bloody buckle-strap beatings as a result of the investigation and the ensuing grand jury condemnation written by mr black the barbarism was eliminated throughout his years on the supreme court he was consistently against the confession system of justice indeed his first statement on the subject was described as one of his best opinions it came in 1940 and he spoke for a unanimous court in chambers v florida a highly publicized murder case in which four negro tenant farmers were convicted on confessions extracted after six days of nonstop questioning in reversing the convictions justice black then in his third court term wrote one of his most widely quoted lines: \"under our constitutional system courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless weak outnumbered or because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice and public excitement\" the decision was announced on lincoln birthday the following day president roosevelt suggested at a news conference that the newspapers apologize to justice black for the slurs they had cast upon him because of his membership in the ku klux klan in the early nineteen- twenties the episode to which the president referred was this: mr black had joined the robert e lee klan no 1 of birmingham on sept 11 1923 and remained for two years at the time he was a prosperous birmingham trial lawyer representing labor unions including the united mine workers and arguing personal injury cases the blossoming of his law practice came after he left the prosecutor post to join the army in 1917 on sept 13 1937 one month after the senate had approved 63 to 16 his nomination to the supreme court the pittsburgh post-gazette charged that mr black not only had been a member of the klan but also was still in the organization the story was leaked by the klan series won prize the series won a pulitzer prize for ray sprigle the reporter although most of the revelations had appeared years before in the alabama press mr sprigle first article began: \"hugo l black associate justice of the united states supreme court is a member of the hooded brotherhood that for 10 long blood-drenched years ruled the southland with lash and noose and torch the invisible empire knights of the ku klux klan he holds his membership in the masked and oath-bound legion as he holds his office on the nation supreme tribunal--for life\" the reporter assertion that the new justice still belonged to the klan was based on a \"grand passport\" that mr black had been given after his 1926 primary victory for the senate the document said nothing about life membership but mr sprigle made much of the fact that it contained no expiration date since mr black accepted the passport personally a year after his resignation from the klan the reporter concluded that the resignation was fraudulent vacationing in europe at the time justice black refused to comment on the reports when he returned however he asked for and received free radio time not wanting his words to be distorted by what was then an extremely hostile press on the night of oct 1 1937 mr black made his first and last public remarks on the issue to an audience estimated at 50 million he admitted that he had been a member of the klan but categorically denied that he still was saying that the \"unsolicited card\" given to him after his senate nomination was not considered by him to be \"membership of any kind\" \"i never used it\" he said \"i did not even keep it before becoming a senator i dropped the klan i have had nothing to do with it since that time    i have no sympathy with any group which anywhere or at any time arrogates to itself the un-american power to interfere in the slightest with complete religious freedom\" assailed by newspapers the newspapers were unimpressed the new york herald tribune called him a \"coward\" the columnist david lawrence said he was \"  an insult to the millions of catholics protestants jews white and colored citizens\" and the magazine american mercury described him as \"a vulgar dog\" \"at every session of the court\" the new york times said editorially \"the presence on the bench of a justice who has worn the white robe of the ku klux klan will stand as a living symbol of the fact that here the cause of liberalism was unwittingly betrayed\" justice black never publicly explained why he had joined the klan but in a 1967 interview with the new york times which he understood would not be published until his death he gave the following account: \"the klan in those days was not what it became later there were a few extremists in it but most of the people were the cream of birmingham middle-class it was a fraternal organization really it wasn\\'t anti-catholic anti-jewish or anti-negro\" \"in fact it was a jew my closest friend herman beck who asked me to join said they needed good people in the klan he couldn\\'t be in it of course but he wanted me to be in it to keep down the few extremists you know when i said on the radio that some of my best friends were jews they told me later that was an anti-semitic remark except that in my case it was true \"anyway the only reason i didn\\'t join before i did was i was too busy with other organizations knights of pythias odd fellows others but before i finally agreed to join on the night i was supposed to join i got up first and spoke and told \\'em i was against hate i liked negroes i liked jews i liked catholics and that if i saw any illegality goin\\' on i wouldn\\'t worry about any secrecy i\\'d turn \\'em into the grand jury \"well when i finished they cheered and they said to me that what you\\'re obligated to do under our rules and they were right that what the rules said anything illegal no secrecy\" then justice black leaned back in his chair and said with a boyish grin: \"you want to know the main reason i joined the klan \"i was trying a lot of cases against corporations jury cases and i found out that all the corporation lawyers were in the klan a lot of the jurors were too so i figured i\\'d better be even-up\" he chuckled and said \"i haven\\'t told that before but that how it was people think it was politics but it wasn\\'t politics i wanted that even chance with the juries\" first term in senate justice black came to the court from the senate to which he was first elected in 1926 he was less than a flaming liberal in his first term offering a bill to suspend immigration and leading a battle against federal antilynching legislation but in some areas he presaged the new deal as when with senator george w norris he fought private power interests on what was later to become the tennessee valley authority and the klan was unhappy with his fight to safeguard the negro position in federal legislation on fair labor standards during his first senate term mr black began to seriously add to his slim education with extensive reading a habit he kept throughout his life beginning with adam smith \"inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations\" he delved deeply into american greek roman and european history he read all of thomas jefferson writings he studied the records of the federal constitutional convention and of the state ratifying conventions a task that served him well years later on the court he also read philosophy and such 19th-century american writers as mark twain thoreau and hawthorne in his second term now as senior senator mr black blossomed forth in the opening week of the first new deal session in 1933 he introduced a bill to limit the work week to 30 hours in an effort to reduce unemployment and stabilize production it passed the senate but was hit with a crippling house amendment as a result president roosevelt supported instead the national industrial recovery act but the work-week bill was the precursor of one of mr black ranking achievements in the senate the fair labor standards act or wage-hour act of 1938 the last piece of new deal legislation to pass congress enacted shortly after he joined the court mr black had voted against the nra one of the few occasions in which he opposed the president he felt its price-fixing provisions among other things gave too much power to business the bill was later declared unconstitutional another major accomplishment in the senate was the public utility holding company act of 1935 which could not have passed without mr black investigation of the utilities lobby the act was designed to break up utility holding company systems the utility lobby fought hard to kill the bill--too hard as it turned out senator black tenacious investigation which made him a national figure brought out the fact that the lobby had corrupted newspapers and sent a flood of spurious telegrams and letters to congressmen supported roosevelt plan in the senate too mr black was a leader in president roosevelt fight to add six justices to the supreme court the so-called \"court-packing\" plan the issue deeply divided the country in 1937 republicans and conservative democrats accused the president of attempting a naked power grab and many liberals argued that the plan would set a dangerous precedent on the other hand there were many in the depression-ridden nation who agreed with mr black that the court was distorting the constitution and freezing the country into a 19th-century economy they argued that the court was imposing its own views on the nation by interpreting the fifth amendment due process clause to insulate business and property from federal regulation and the 14th amendment due process clause to prevent state governments from relieving depression hardships the roosevelt plan finally died in the senate but not before the court probably under the political pressure of the attack switched its course by one vote in a couple of key state cases and in two major federal cases validating the national labor relations act and the social security act in the meantime mr black soon to be named to the court developed his antipathy to the concept of \"substantive due process\" an antipathy he maintained throughout his life under that concept the court could receive the \"reasonableness of state and federal legislation balancing the pubic interest against private property rights in determining the validity of social and regulatory legislation as a result over a 50-year period preceding mr black appointment the court had knocked out child-labor laws minimum-wage laws and other state legislation designed to help the poor federally it had declared unconstitutional such new deal programs as the nira and the agricultural adjustment act \"that why i came on the court\" justice black said in 1967 \"i was against using due process to force the views of judges on the country i still am i wouldn\\'t trust judges with that kind of power and the founders did not trust them either\" his appointment was considered a stroke of rooseveltian genius coming on the heels of the defeat of the court bill it might have been stopped in the senate since the president was at the moment unpopular with the legislators over the pressures exerted to pass the bill moreover mr black was a liberal indeed a radical in 1937 terms and outspokenly against the trend of the court but senatorial courtesy prevailed as the president must have expected and mr black took the seat of the retiring willis van devanter one of the so-called \"four horsemen of reaction\" possibly because of his fear of unbridled judicial power justice black developed his controversial theory first stated in a lengthy scholarly dissent in 1947 that the due process clause applied the first eight amendments of the bill of rights to the states he came within a vote of swinging the court to that view in adamson v california a case in which he argued that the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination forbade a prosecutor to comment on a defendant failure to take the witness stand while the court was never fully won over to the black idea it accepted most of it across the years and overthrew the adamson ruling in 1965 justice black argument in adamson was criticized at times even by close friends as \"an advocate history\" but he was always convinced that the men who drew up the amendment had in mind and had so informed the congress that the 14th would \"pick up\" the bill of rights and apply it to the states for two years before he wrote his monumental dissent he studied the history of the 14th amendment and later he said: called others activists \"if i didn\\'t find that this was their view my career on the court would have been entirely different i would not have gone with due process and i\\'d be considered the most reactionary judge on the court\" ironically for all his distaste for judicial lawmaking justice black was known through most of his career as the dean of the \"judicial activists\" a term connoting at least popularly the heavy use of judicial fire-power and indeed the \"active\" court was a proper description of what he stood for and forged during his career but it must be seen in the context of his view of the constitution his abiding belief was that its framers had wrought well that they had created a balance under which the country could grow economically while preserving the basic individual freedoms for the court then to strike down legislation or official acts that violated these freedoms was to him an obligation a \"sacred trust\" more important even than the court duty to refrain from intruding on the rightful ie economic and social provinces of legislators thus he could say in 1967: \"i think of myself as being less of an activist than anyone on the court\" his view was that such \"self-restraint\" justices as frankfurter and john marshall harlan were in truth the activists since they would toy with the words of the constitution and interpose a judge view of \"reasonableness\" between an act and the great charter that this was more than semantics was dramatically shown when justice black refuse to support the negro civil disobedience movement voted to uphold the virginia poll tax and declined to overthrow the connecticut anti-birth control statute aside from these latter-day votes there were few times in his career when he disappointed libertarians in the nineteen-fifties he stood often only with justice williams o douglas \"against any winds that blow\" when mccarthyism nearly engulfed the country \"public opinion being what it now is\" he wrote in his famous dissent in the dennis case in which the court upheld the conviction of 11 top american communists on the grounds that they had conspired to advocate overthrow of the government \"few will protest the conviction of these communist petitioners there is hope however that in calmer times when present pressure passions and fears subside this or some later court will restore the first amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society\" to a considerable extent \"some later court\" did largely as a result of mr black teachings and forceful campaigning among the justices opinion drew wide criticism justice black never expressed any doubts regarding his most heavily criticized opinion for the court in the 1944 case of korematsu vs u s in this he upheld the right of the military to evacuate japanese-american citizens from the west coat after the attack on pearl harbor \"such exclusion\" justice murphy said in dissent \"goes over the very brink of constitutional power and falls into the ugly abyss of racism\" justice black opinion was considered by many to be one of the most antiliberal judgments in supreme court history but in 1967 its author had this to say about it: \"i would do precisely the same thing today in any part of the country i would probably issue the same order were i president we had a situation where we were at war people were rightly fearful of the japanese in los angels many loyal to the united states many undoubtedly not having dual citizenship--lots of them \"they all look alike to a person not a jap had they [the japanese] attacked our shores you\\'d have a large number fighting with the japanese troops and a lot of innocent japanese-americans would have been shot in the panic under these circumstances i saw nothing wrong in moving them away from the danger area\" however dismayed justice black admirers were by the korematsu case they could and did view it as aberrational not so however his votes and opinions over the years on the fourth amendment proscriptions against unreasonable searches and seizures he almost invariably upset and perplexed libertarians with his narrow view of the amendment scope for years he held with justice frankfurter that evidence illegally seized by the police was not excludable from state trials when he finally switched on this in 1961 he did so only because he found it to be a violation of the fifth amendment bar against self-incrimination warrant procedures upheld moreover in case after case he voted to uphold questionable warrant procedures finally in 1967 he said that the fourth amendment was no protection whatever against electronic eavesdropping his rationale was generally that the amendment prohibited only \"unreasonable\" searches and seizures and that it did not of itself include a rule excluding fruits of an illegal seizure from evidence while this rationale could be consistently read with his often-stated view that the constitution must be taken literally it did not square with the fact that he had consistently interpreted the rest of the bill of rights with what one expert called \"that spirit which giveth life\" \"i\\'m oriented towards the bill of rights\" justice black said a few years ago \"in the direction of giving the prohibitory clauses a liberal interpretation to bring about what should be brought about but i just can\\'t do it with the fourth amendment\" justice black married twice his first wife whom he wed in 1921 was josephine foster a birmingham minister daughter the couple had three children hugo jr and sterlin foster who both became lawyers and mrs martha josephine pesarisi the wife of a new jersey psychiatrist mrs black died in 1951 in 1957 justice black married his secretary mrs elizabeth seay demeritte a fellow alabaman both were fine dancers and excellent hosts the justice taught her to play tennis and they regularly used the courts behind their 18th-century

       " 'linus c pauling a brilliant chemist and an untiring political activist who received one nobel prize for chemistry and another for peace died on friday at his ranch in the big sur area of northern california he was 93 the cause was cancer said steve lawson chief executive officer of the linus pauling institute of science and medicine in palo alto calif dr pauling received the prize for chemistry in 1954 as a result of his research into the nature of the chemical bond the force that gives atoms the cohesiveness to form the molecules that in turn become the basis of all physical matter in 1962 at age 61 he received the nobel peace prize the award citation acclaimed him for his work since 1946 \"not only against the testing of nuclear weapons not only against the spread of these armaments not only against their very use but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts\" dr pauling was also said to have provided powerful impetus to others in achieving what many came to regard as the medical discovery of the century that was the determination of the structure of dna or deoxyribonucleic acid the genetic material in all living organisms to those who eventually won the race to solve dna dr pauling was seen at the time as the closest rival had he been the victor he no doubt would have been the recipient of a third nobel prize dr pauling scientific genius was accompanied by a strong penchant for dissent he touched off a debate among scientists in his later years for example by vigorously advocating that vitamin c if taken in large-enough doses would build up the immune systems in humans and protect them against infectious diseases in the 1950 he was a primary shaper of the antinuclear-testing movement and he was actively involved in the antiwar movement in the 1960 by the time he received the chemistry prize at the age of 53 he had long been recognized as a chemist chemist by the age of 30 he had already published 50 papers based on original chemical research and had risen to a full professorship at the california institute of technology his years at the institute from 1927 to 1963 marked the most productive period of his professional career in 1931 when dr pauling received the american chemical society award in pure chemistry arthur a noyes president of the gates chemical laboratory at pasadena calif prophetically called the young scientist \"a rising star who may yet win the nobel prize\" dr pauling grasp of the nature of chemical bonds and molecular structure was so formidable that albert einstein whom he met that year said he would have to \"brush up on the subject\" of chemical bonds before again trying to engage the young dr pauling in a conversation in 1939 dr pauling published \"the nature of the chemical bond\" a book that won worldwide recognition among scientific researchers as a landmark work throughout the 1930 he used quantum mechanics the theoretical framework used to explain the structure of the atom and the motion of atomic particles to investigate chemical bonding he asserted that the \"resonance\" or internal vibrations of atoms gave molecules their cohesiveness joseph e mayer a professor of chemistry at columbia university once praised him as a \"rarity among scientists -- a chemist with mathematical and geometrical intuition\" growing evidence of social conscience while dr pauling was winning international plaudits as a theoretical chemist he was also developing a reputation as a scientist with a social conscience but some critics believed he sometimes overlooked national concerns in advocating social policies and in other actions in world war ii he ignored the widespread resentment against japanese-americans and hired a young man whose parents were born in japan as a gardener for his home in pasadena vandals later defaced the house with anti-japanese slogans by 1949 he had declared himself an advocate of peace and helped organize a congress for peace held in mexico city his colleagues in this venture included dr w e b dubois the singer paul robeson the actor charlie chaplin and o john rogge a former assistant attorney general of the united states the state department denounced the group as \"moscow-directed\" asserting that it was \"devoted to providing an apologia for the moscow point of view\" the next year dr pauling joined with seven other prominent americans to start a \"peace crusade\" a forerunner of peace movements that were to win the support of many americans two decades later in explaining his action he said that the possibility of war was becoming greater \"with the continued increase in man powers of destruction\" and that \"it is the duty of every american to work for a peaceful solution of international arguments\" he incurred the suspicion of senator joseph r mccarthy the wisconsin republican who was chairman of senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and mr mccarthy accused him of having a \"well nigh incredible\" record of membership in communist front organizations dr pauling denied under oath that he was ever a communist partly as a result of the senator attack the state department denied dr pauling a passport in april 1952 holding that it would be contrary to national interest to permit him to travel abroad there seemed to be a feeling that dr pauling might go to the soviet union in fact he wanted only to go to london with his wife ava to participate in a conference on the structure of proteins dr pauling said the state department informed him that his passport application had been denied because of the suspicion that he was a communist attacked by stalin as anti-marxist the suspicion that dr pauling might be sympathetic to the soviet union persisted even though his theory of resonance had made him a persona non grata in the soviet union where stalin believed that the theory was incompatible with communist ideology in 1951 the russians denounced the theory as \"pseudo- scientific\" \"vicious\" and an example of world outlooks \"hostile to the marxist view\" dr pauling book \"the nature of the chemical bond\" was regarded as hostile to the dialectical materialism of marx engels and lenin dr pauling countered by calling stalinist science distorted by july 1952 after a number of efforts dr pauling managed to obtain a \"limited passport\" for travel to britain and france in 1954 he received an unrestricted passport so he could travel to stockholm to receive his first nobel prize after returning from stockholm dr pauling was as outspoken as ever he castigated the government for its treatment of j robert oppenheimer a crucial scientist in the development of the atomic bomb whose security clearance had been withdrawn because of concerns about his patriotism dr pauling called it \"the worst case of national ingratitude i know\" alluding to dr oppenheimer opposition to the government crash program to develop a hydrogen bomb he declared \"advisers to the government if they are to be valuable must be free to express their opinions\" throughout the 1950 dr pauling seemed a scientist in perpetual motion pursuing research in such areas as possible biochemical aspects of schizophrenia the nature of nucleic acids and hereditary faults in body chemistry sickle-cell anemia that were caused by abnormal molecules in the early 1950 dr james d watson and sir francis crick were constantly looking over their shoulders at the body of the research of linus pauling with a mixture of admiration and apprehension dr watson and sir francis were at the time feverishly trying to determine that structure that is crucial to the construction of all living cells -- dna -- and dr pauling was pursuing the same goal writing years later in \"the double helix\" a book about the discovery dr watson described dr pauling presentation of work showing in part the helical structure of proteins the passage reveals not only the high esteem in which dr pauling was held by his colleagues but also the intense envy he sometimes engendered \"pauling talk was done with his usual flair\" dr watson wrote \"the words came out as if he had been in show business all his life a curtain kept his model hidden until near the end of his lecture when he proudly unveiled his latest creation then with his eyes twinkling linus explained the specific characteristics    that made his model uniquely beautiful \"this show like all of his dazzling performances delighted the younger students in attendance there was no one like linus in all the world the combination of his prodigious mind and his infectious grin was unbeatable \"several fellow professors however watched this performance with mixed feelings seeing linus jumping up and down on the demonstration table and moving his arms like a magician about to pull a rabbit out of his shoe made them feel inadequate if only he had shown a little humility it would have been so much easier to take!\" though dr pauling earlier protein research had laid groundwork for the dna discovery his theories in that area did not ultimately prove correct dr watson and sir francis\\' proposition that the basic genetic strands of dna take the shape of a double helix was validated in 1953 and they were awarded the nobel prize nine years later a traditionalist or a radical all the while dr pauling was also pursuing the cause of peace he pressed his attack on the pointlessness of war and what he regarded as a major reason for the persistence of war: the hypocrisy and short-sightedness of the world politicians calling war outmoded he said \"the major world powers have reached a standoff and they will have to give up war as a maneuver of power politics\" at other times however he expressed doubt that this would happen -- at least not before one last major conflagration after the mccarthy era began to wane he remained sensitive to suggestions that he was politically radical his admirers said any implication that dr pauling was somehow anti-american was unfair regarding him instead as the quintessential american as for radicalism they contended that as the son of an oregon druggist he was inculcated with the values of small-town life in the far west and was at heart a traditionalist linus carl pauling was born feb 28 1901 in portland ore his independent streak and his insistence on standing by his beliefs became apparent early in life he never received a real high school diploma because he dropped out of washington high school in portland as a form of protest against taking courses he regarded as pointless but he gained entrance to oregon agricultural college without a high school diploma and the young man majoring in chemical engineering was quickly recognized as a prodigy he received his bachelor of science degree in 1922 and the following year he married ava helen miller two years later he received his phd from caltech in later years dr pauling candid criticism of the united states angered conservative americans in 1958 for example he appeared on a television interview program where he was asked by a reporter how the united states could trust the soviet union enough to sign a test ban treaty with them since they had \"broken so many agreements\" \"well the united states has broken many agreements too international agreements and treaties\" he replied \"nations keep agreements keep their treaties so long as they continue to do them good\" around 1960 he began a campaign to obtain the signatures of scientists opposed to nuclear testing a total of 11021 scientists in 49 countries signed the petitions the tone of the petition and its success angered some people in government and in 1960 dr pauling was subpoenaed to testify before the senate internal security subcommittee \"on communist participation in or support of a propaganda campaign against nuclear testing\" \"i don\\'t know anything\" about communist activity\" he said emphasizing that his opposition to nuclear testing was part of his opposition to nuclear war and his longstanding concern about the biological effects of radioactivity indeed dr pauling was so concerned about the harmful effects of radioactivity that he warned that people should \"change dentists\" if theirs recommended annual or semiannual full mouth x-rays for children he refused to divulge the names of scientists who had helped him circulate the petitions calling for a nuclear test ban asserting that he feared that the government would subject his colleagues to reprisals \"my conscience\" he said \"will not allow me to protect myself by sacrificing these idealistic young people i am not going to do it!\" the senate subcommittee excused dr pauling without issuing orders for him to divulge the names of those who had helped him and the matter was dropped thus avoiding a showdown when dr pauling won the nobel peace prize in 1962 it was the first time anyone had won two nobel prizes since marie curie did it in 1903 and 1911 and unlike mme curie dr pauling won his alone not sharing it with another scientist as she did the honor apparently moved washington high the school that had denied dr pauling a diploma in his youth to award him an honorary diploma receiving honors and speaking out winning both the nobel peace prize and an honorary diploma from washington high did nothing to mellow dr pauling or to cause him to rest on his laurels indeed these new distinctions seemed only to encourage him in his efforts to prevent nuclear war in april 1962 president and mrs kennedy invited dr pauling and 48 other nobel laureates to the white house for dinner it was a most impressive gathering but dr pauling joined it only after picketing the white house with members of the woman strike for peace who were protesting the resumption by the united states of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons the american press was not so sure the nobel committee had chosen the right candidate in an editorial titled \"the nobel peacenik prize\" the herald tribune in new york said that \"award of the nobel peace prize to dr pauling whatever the committee reasons inevitably associates this semisacrosanct honor with the extravagant posturings of a placarding peacenik\" the new york times in an editorial noted: \"professor pauling has been a persistent and effective agitator in his fight for international peace and against the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons he has not always been wise in his choice of tactics and he has sometimes been reckless\" but the times agreed with gunnar jahn chairman of the norwegian parliamentary committee that chose dr pauling for the prize that it was reasonable to ask if a nuclear test ban treaty would have been signed without the likes of dr pauling he left caltech in 1963 and went to the center for the study of democratic institutions in 1967 he moved to the university of california at san diego and remained there until 1969 when he switched to stanford university after his 70th birthday when he was forced to retire from stanford he set up the linus pauling institute of science and medicine his collaborator in the venture was dr arthur b robinson one of his former students at caltech he thus began a phase of his life that proved to be as controversial as his earlier periods of political activism creating a furor on vitamin c a scientific debate was touched off by his book \"vitamin c and the common cold\" published in 1970 in which he proposed that massive doses of vitamin c could prevent the common cold \"that suggestion made by so pre-eminent a scientist as linus pauling caused such a run on vitamin c that pharmacies were unable to maintain adequate supplies\" the wall street journal reported \"seldom has a pronouncement caused such a run on anything\" the debate droned on through the 1970 with some scientists supporting dr pauling and others saying that his advice was speculative by the middle of the decade a number of controlled experiments had found no cold-preventive benefits from vitamin c dr pauling with characteristic independence then elaborated on his original thesis and suggested that the vitamin might also be of help in treating cancer this touched off still more spirited response from the scientific community in 1979 a report compiled by a research team from the mayo clinic said that experiments on 150 patients with advanced cancer showed no benefits from vitamin c the findings were published in the new england journal of medicine in addition to the public turmoil about his work there were private problems too dr robinson the former student was dismissed from the linus pauling institute he responded by charging that he not dr pauling had done the experimental work at the institute and that \"linus has not personally contributed significant research work on vitamin c and human health\" among the people who had worked with dr pauling in the antinuclear movement was his wife who had become in her own right a vigorous proponent of peace and human rights on dec 7 1981 after 58 years of marriage and rearing four children she died at the age 77 to the end linus pauling almost always wearing his signature beret remained irreverent iconoclastic and outspoken in 1976 shortly after he had turned 75 he addressed a meeting of the american chemical society which was observing its centennial he tried to predict what might be expected of chemistry and of the world in the century to come although he described himself as \"optimistic\" he went on to say: \"i am forced as i think about what has happened in the world during my lifetime and as i observe governments in their processes of making decisions to conclude that the coming century is probably going to be one in which the amount of suffering reaches its maximum\" \"unless we are wiser than we have shown ourselves to be in the past\" he added \"we chemists and we citizens we advisers of government and we government officials there will be a catastrophe during the coming century perhaps a series of catastrophes the human race might survive by 2076 we shall i hope have solved these problems and from then on we may have a world in which every person who is born will have the opportunity to lead a good life\" surviving dr pauling are three sons dr peter of wales linus jr of honolulu crellin of portola valley calif; a daughter linda pauling kamb of pasadena; a sister pauline emmett of salt lake city; 15 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren',\n",

       " 'prime minister yitzhak rabin of israel who was shot dead yesterday at age 73 was a soldier turned statesman who led his country into uncharted territory to make peace with the palestinians and put an end to the wars bloodshed and terrorism that had plagued his country since its founding it was general rabin the commander in chief of israel armed forces in 1967 who had led the lightning strike that captured broad swaths of arab territories twenty-six years later on sept 13 1993 it was prime minister rabin who reluctantly extended his hand to yasir arafat leader of the palestinian liberation organization to put a symbolic seal of approval on an accord that would lead to the return of much of that territory and to palestinian self-rule on the israeli-occupied west bank and the gaza strip in an extraordinary ceremony on the south lawn of the white house one that few had ever expected to see mr rabin came face-to-face with mr arafat -- the man who had been reviled for decades by israelis as the mastermind behind one attack after another on their people the man with whom the following year he and his foreign minister shimon peres would share the nobel peace prize \"the time for peace has come\" mr rabin declared \"we the soldiers who have returned from battles stained with blood we who have seen our relatives and friends killed before our eyes    we who have come from a land where parents bury their children we who have fought against you the palestinians -- we say today in a loud and clear voice: enough of blood and tears enough\" speaking as much to his own people as to the astonished world that was watching mr rabin explained in mournful tones how painful and how necessary it was for israel to take this step \"it not so easy -- either for myself as a soldier in israel war nor for the people of israel    it is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the war violence terror whose pain will never heal for the many thousands who defended our lives and their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our own for them this ceremony has come too late\" but he said israel was not seeking revenge it was seeking peace the tragedy was that some of mr rabin own people were seeking revenge as mr rabin came closer to achieving his goal of peace a wide schism opened within the israeli populace much of the bitterness of those opposed to making peace with israel historic enemies was directed at mr rabin and he became the soldier who paid the ultimate price to make peace he had been unrelenting in his drive to institutionalize that peace only a month ago mr rabin took part in another white house ceremony to mark the beginning of another withdrawal from the west bank this time the handshakes with mr arafat were less reluctant and the peace process was well established a new generation brings a new vision mr rabin was the only one of israel eight prime ministers to have been born in the land of palestine a sabra who had not experienced the long history of attacks on european jewry and the horror of the holocaust with his election israel turned over its leadership from the fathers to the sons and he appealed for a new vision on taking office in 1992 for his second term as prime minister mr rabin said it was time for israel to jettison its siege mentality \"no longer is it true that the whole world is against us\" he said he accepted his election as a mandate to make peace one of his first steps was to put a freeze on all new construction in the occupied territories for their part the palestinians were ready to deal with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union the plo was deprived of diplomatic financial and military support at the same time the plo was reeling from the loss of contributions from wealthy arab states angered by mr arafat support of iraq during the 1991 persian gulf war to achieve agreement with the palestinians mr rabin followed the lead of foreign minister peres a labor party colleague and longtime political rival they had fought for decades over the leadership of the party and the country but they joined forces in the search for peace to the opposition that branded mr rabin a \"traitor\" the prime minister replied that peace must be made with enemies not with friends mr rabin had been at the center of the major events in his nation history for five decades in 1948 he fought in the siege of jerusalem during israel war of independence in 1967 as chief of staff of the israeli army for the three years before the june war he brought to fighting strength the formidable force that rolled over three arab armies in six days later as ambassador to the united states he helped assure israel a steady supply of sophisticated weapons in his first term as prime minister he negotiated the crucial and lasting disengagement of israeli and egyptian forces in the sinai which paved the way for the camp david accords and as defense minister in 1986 he presided over the withdrawal of israeli forces from lebanon although he continued to respond with force to terrorist attacks never charismatic but a man to be trusted as a boy growing up in palestine mr rabin wanted to be an agronomist and attended the kadoorie agricultural school in galilee where he won the high commissioner gold medal as the best student in palestine but like many patriotic young people of his time he gave up his childhood ambition and joined the palmach the elite strike force of the haganah underground jewish army saw action in world war ii and developed into a brilliant military tactician he also developed into a politician israelis trusted him for his single-minded devotion to the good of the country and he was repeatedly asked to accept high government positions but he was the antithesis of the convivial party man taciturn introspective controlled intensely private he had almost no close advisers and reached decisions independently often announcing them in an authoritarian manner that alienated the party leadership he spoke in a deep monotone that made his public personality seem colorless and even in private he was almost devoid of humor mr rabin was born in jerusalem on march 1 1922 his father nehemiah who came from a poor family in ukraine had escaped from czarist russia and gone to palestine by way of chicago and st louisin palestine he became a trade union organizer in the labor movement of david ben-gurion his mother rosa cohen born to a well-to-do family in gomel russia was active in politics and became the dominant influence on the young rabin theirs was a home where young yitzhak was taught that public service was a duty and where he remembered \"it was a disgrace to speak about money\" he was 7 years old when arabs began attacking jewish settlements later during the 1936 arab riots and general strike he was at the khadouri school where he was trained in the use of arms by yigal allon who was later to become his commander and his mentor five years later during world war ii moshe dayan then a young commander in the haganah invited mr rabin to join the palmach as part of the british invasion of greater syria which was in the hands of the axis powers mr rabin was sent across the border the youngest in his unit it was his job to climb up telephone poles to cut the wires so the collaborationist vichy french forces could not call up reinforcements in june 1945 just after the end of the war in europe mr rabin commanded a daring raid to liberate about 200 illegal jewish immigrants held by the british in a camp at athlit on the mediterranean just south of haifa the exploit was said to be the prototype for a similar raid in the novel \"exodus\" and mr rabin the prototype for ari ben canaan the hero played in the movie version by paul newman but the shy mr rabin always insisted that he was not the fictional ari ben canaan mr rabin was arrested by the british and imprisoned for six months in a camp in gaza soon after he was released the british turned the problem of palestine over to the united nations which in 1947 voted for partition into a jewish and an arab state the arabs attacked and as hostilities intensified between the jews and the arabs mr allon then the commander of the palmach appointed mr rabin his deputy during the 1948 israeli war of independence mr rabin commanded the har-el brigade a makeshift unit that failed to take jerusalem for israel but kept open the vital supply lines between jerusalem and the sea later with the rank of colonel mr rabin served on the southern front against egyptian forces when mr rabin disclosed in his 1979 memoir his role in forcing 50000 arab civilians to leave their homes at gunpoint during the war of independence there was a furor in israel where officials had long denied that arab civilians were pushed out of their lands in the middle of the war on aug 23 1948 mr rabin married leah schlossberg who had joined the palmach and served in his battalion they had two children a son yuval and a daughter dalia and three grandchildren they all survive him mr rabin first venture into diplomacy came when he was sent to the island of rhodes as part of the delegation to the israeli-egyptian armistice talks in 1949 in 1953 having finally committed himself to a career in the army mr rabin went to england to study at the british staff college at camberley back home he went on to hold a series of high posts in the israeli army mainly involving manpower training and was named chief of staff in 1964 he became israel top expert on military matters even as he rose through the ranks he became known as the man who who knew more than the generals eventually he became a general himself a lieutenant-general the army that fought the six-day war in 1967 was essentially mr rabin army shab\\'tai teveth professor of history at tel aviv university said \"it was the army he trained planned built and armed in his three years as chief of staff\" but he added \"there his glory ends\" his \"glory\" ended when on the eve of the fighting mr rabin suffered a nervous collapse the terrible burden of leadership in war in his memoir mr rabin wrote of going to see mr ben-gurion then in retirement he went in search of encouragement but instead got a dressing-down mr ben-gurion he wrote scolded him for mobilizing the reserves after president gamal abdel nasser of egypt closed the straits of tiran \"you have led the state into a grave situation\" mr ben-gurion told him \"we must not go to war we are isolated you bear the responsibility\" mr ben-gurion words reverberated in his ears as he worked himself into a state of physical and mental exhaustion he recovered in time to carry out his duties during the war but some observers thought he was not functioning normally and was only being \"propped up\" so that the troops and the people would not lose confidence in their leader whatever the source of mr rabin difficulties the results achieved by his army were astonishingly clear at the end of the war hebrew university conferred on him an honorary doctorate in a modest occasionally poetic speech mr rabin said he accepted the honor not for himself but as the representative of an army of civilians who had never been trained for conquest of battle-hardened paratroopers who had leaned on the stones of the wailing wall and wept at the capture of the old city of jerusalem he spoke about his army but perhaps even more about himself \"our sabra youth and most certainly our soldiers\" he said \"do not tend to be sentimental and they shrink from any public show of feeling but the strain of battle the anxiety which preceded it and the sense of salvation and of direct confrontation with jewish history itself cracked the shell of hardness and shyness and released wellsprings of emotion and stirrings of the spirit\" in 1968 mr rabin was appointed ambassador to the united states where he became known as an effective advocate for israel and a master at procuring sophisticated american weapons in his five years as ambassador he developed a close relationship with henry a kissinger president richard m nixon national security adviser and later his secretary of state mr kissinger called on him for intelligence about troop movements in the middle east and even consulted him on vietnam shortly after he returned to israel in 1973 mr rabin entered national politics for the first time then on yom kippur while the country was in the middle of an election campaign syria and egypt launched a surprise attack the country leaders -- prime minister golda meir and her minister of defense mr dayan -- were held responsible for the country lack of preparedness in that october war but the labor party won enough votes to form a new government mr rabin won in his first attempt at election and was given the post of minister of labor but within a month of forming her cabinet mrs meir resigned and the party turned to mr rabin who had been out of power at the time of the war and was therefore untainted by the heavy casualties diplomatic departures and a final legacy in 1974 mr rabin became israel fifth prime minister and at 52 its youngest \"the time has come\" he said \"for the sons of the founders of the state to take over their role\" mr rabin became the first israeli prime minister to make an official visit to west germany he also said he met secretly with king hussein of jordan six times in an unsuccessful effort to open peace negotiations with him his government weathered the arab oil embargo and the skyrocketing prices of oil and negotiated a second sinai disengagement with the egyptians but only after incurring the wrath of mr kissinger when it turned down one of his early proposals the secretary of state returned to washington in march 1975 and persuaded president ford to undertake a \"reassessment\" of american policy toward israel a move seen as a threat to withhold arms shipments mr rabin had been ready to negotiate what he called \"a piece of land for a piece of peace\" but he believed the plan mr kissinger brought back during his shuttle trips between cairo and jerusalem demanded maximum israeli territorial concessions in exchange for minimal egyptian political concessions mr schiff of the newspaper haaretz said that mr rabin had been \"absolutely right to say \\'no\\' to the americans\" and in doing so to win in the long run \"it caused a rift between the egyptians and the syrians this was as important a cornerstone on the road to camp david as the yom kippur war\" five months later he accepted what he called a \"risk for peace\" and signed an egyptian-israeli disengagement agreement during his term as prime minister mr rabin faced down terrorists who hijacked an air france plane en route from tel aviv to paris at first he was seen as weak because he waited several days before dispatching an assault group to entebbe uganda where the plane and almost 100 israeli citizens were being held hostage when he finally approved a military operation and when the daring raid succeeded he was hailed as a hero but in 1977 his image was damaged when an israeli newspaper disclosed that he and his wife had violated currency laws by maintaining bank accounts in the united states after he had returned home at first he lied about how much money was in the accounts and finally he was forced to step down opening the way for the victory of menachem begin and the likud party mr rabin accepted responsibility for the bank accounts which had been used mainly by his wife the rabins paid a fine imposed by an israeli court but six months after mr rabin resigned the currency regulations were rescinded mr rabin bounced back from the scandal not because he was a skilled politician but because he was not a politician at all he returned to government as minister of defense in a labor-likud national unity coalition that presided over the israeli pullout from lebanon his was the policy of the \"iron fist\" promising swift retaliation for guerrilla raids against israelis withdrawing from southern lebanon sitting in his office at the defense ministry one evening in 1987 he looked back at his life with satisfaction tinged with disappointment his disappointment he said was in what he saw as a loss of national spirit the failure of the creators of the state to pass on their sense of commitment of his most satisfying moment he had no doubt -- the liberation and unification of jerusalem in 1967 but there was more a legacy delivered that day in 1993 when he led the country to come to terms with the palestinians \"to live together on the same soil in the same land\" he acknowledged the risk but in going to washington to endorse the agreement he said \"we have come to try to put an end to the hostilities so that our children our children children will no longer experience the painful cost of war\"',\n",

seventy-sixth year had been in failing health for several months he had not been confined to bed and the end was unexpected late yesterday afternoon however his condition brought about by progressive anemia became serious and dr ker of washington a cousin of mrs bell a house guest and a sydney physician attended him with mr bell when he died were mrs bell a daughter mrs marion hubbard fairchild and her husband david g fairchild of washington the inventor leaves another daughter mrs elise m grosvenor wife of gilbert grosvenor of washington who now is with her husband in brazil at sunset on friday on the crest of beinn breach mountain the body of dr bell will be buried at a spot chosen by the inventor himself the grave of the venerable scientist the immensity of whose life work was attested by scores of telegrams which came today to the bell estate from the world prominent figures is at a point overlooking the town of baddeck cape breton the sweeping vista from the mountain top so admired by dr bell stretches far over the bras d\\'or lakes sunset chosen as the moment when the body will be committed to the sturdy hills gilds the waters of the lakes until they are really what their name means--\"the lakes of the arm of gold\" dr bell asked to be buried in the countryside where he had spent the major portion of the last thirty-five years of his life the inventor came to cape breton forty years ago and five years later purchased the beinn breagh estate his last experiments dealing with flying boats were made on bras d\\'or lake american specialists who were rushing to the bedside of dr bell were today returning to the united states they were told of his death while aboard fast trains bound for baddeck and being too late turned back alexander graham bell lived to see the telephonic instrument over which he talked a distance of twenty feet in 1876 used with improvements for the transmission of speech across the continent and more than that for the transmission of speech across the atlantic and from washington to honolulu without wires the little instrument he patented less than fifty years ago scorned then as a joke was when he died the basis for 13000000 telephones used in every civilized country in the world the bell basic patent the famed no 174465 which he received on his twenty-ninth birthday and which was sustained in a historic court fight has been called the most valuable patent ever issued although the inventor of many contrivances which he regarded with as much tenderness and to which he attached as much importance as the telephone a business world which he confessed he was often unable to understand made it assured that he would go down in history as the man who made the telephone he was an inventor of the gramophone and for nearly twenty years was engaged in aeronautics associated with glenn h curtiss and others whose names are now known wherever airplanes fly he pinned his faith in the efficacy for aviation of the tetrahedral cell which never achieved the success he saw for it in aviation but as a by-product of his study he established an important new principle in architecture up to the time of his death dr bell took the deepest interest in aviation upon his return from a tour of the european countries in 1909 he reported that the continental nations were far ahead of america in aviation and urged that steps by taken to keep apace of them he predicted in 1916 that the great war would be won in the air it was always a theory of his that flying machines could make ever so much more speed at great heights in rarefied atmosphere and he often said that the transatlantic flight would be some time made in one day a prediction which he lived to see fulfilled a teacher of deaf mutes the inventor of the telephone was born in edinburgh on march 3 1847 means of communication had been a hobby in the bell family long before alexander was born his grandfather was the inventor of a device for overcoming stammering and his father perfected a system of visible speech for deaf mutes when alexander was about 15 years old he made an artificial skull of guttapercha and india rubber that would pronounce weird tones when blown into by a hand bellows at the age of 16 he became like his father a teacher of elocution and instructor of deaf mutes when young bell was 22 years old he was threatened with tuberculosis which had caused the death of his two brothers and the bell family migrated to brantford canada soon after he came to america at a meeting with sir charles wheatstone the english inventor bell got the ambition to perfect a musical or multiple telegraph his father in an address in boston one day not long after mentioned his son success in teaching deaf mutes which led the boston board of education to offer the younger bell $500 to introduce his system in the newly opened school for deaf mutes there he was then 24 years old and quickly gained prominence for his teaching methods he was soon named a professor in boston university but teaching interfered with his inventing and he gave up all but two of his pupils one of these was mabel hubbard of a wealthy family she had lost her speech and hearing when a baby and bell took the most acute interest in enabling her to hear she later became mrs bell works three years on telephone bell spent the following three years working mostly at night in a cellar in salem mass gardiner g hubbard his future father-in-law and thomas sanders helped him financially while he worked on his theory that speech could be reproduced by means of an electrically charged wire his first success came while he was testing his instruments in new quarters in boston thomas a watson bell assistant had struck a clock spring at one end of a wire and bell heard the sound in another room for forty weeks he worked on his instruments and on march 10 1876 watson who was working in another room was started to hear bell voice say: \"mr watson come here i want you\" on his twenty-ninth birthday bell received his patent at the centennial in philadelphia he gave the first public demonstration of his instrument he had not intended to go to the exposition he was poor and had planned to take up his teaching again in june he went to the railroad station one day to see miss hubbard off for philadelphia she had believed he was going with her as he put her on the train and it moved off without him she burst into tears seeing this bell rushed ahead and caught the train without baggage or ticket an exhibition on a sunday afternoon was promised to him when the hour arrived it was hot and the judges were tired it looked as if there would be no demonstration for bell when dom pedro the emperor of brazil appeared and shook mr bell by the hand he had heard some of the young man lectures bell made ready for the demonstration a wire had been strung along the room bell took the transmitter and dom pedro placed the receiver to his ear \"my god it talks!\" he exclaimed the lord kelvin took the receiver \"it does speak\" he said \"it is the most wonderful thing i have seen in america\" the judges then took turns listening and the demonstration lasted until 10 o\\'clock that night the instrument was the centre of interest for scientists the rest of the exposition the commercial development of the telephone dated from that day in philadelphia his other inventions while alexander graham bell will be best remembered as the inventor of the telephone a claim he sustained through many legal contests he also became noted for other inventions with sumner tainter he invented the gramophone he invented a new method of lithography a photophone and an induction balance he invented the telephone probe which was used to locate the bullet that killed president garfield he spent fifteen years and more than $200000 in testing his tetrahedral kite which he believed would be the basis for aviation the inventor was the recipient of many honors in this country and abroad the french government conferred on him the decoration of the legion of honor the french academy bestowed on him the volta prize of 50000f the society of arts in london in 1902 gave him the albert medal and the university of wurzburg bavaria gave him a ph d dr bell regarded the summit of his career as reached when in january of 1915 he and his old associate mr watson talked to one another over the telephone from san francisco to new york it was nearly two years later that by a combination of telephonic and wireless telegraphy instruments the engineers of the american telephone and telegraph company sent speech across the atlantic in 1915 dr bell said that he looked forward to the day when men would communicate their thoughts by wire without the spoken word \"the possibilities of further achievement by the use of electricity are inconceivable\" he said \"men can do nearly everything else by electricity already and i can imagine them with coils of wire about their heads coming together for communication of thought by induction\" in april of 1916 he declared that land and sea power would become secondary to air power he expressed then the opinion that the airplane would be more valuable as a fighting machine than the zeppelin and urged that the united states build a strong aerial fleet the inventor last few years were spent in energetic efforts to materialize new dreams and in seeing wider and wider applications of his greatest one in december 1920 he was in london when that city talked by wireless with geneva that same year he perfected a device for cooling houses always he kept working at something more often than not a something far afield from his earlier interests the telephone in fact had palled on him there had piled up 3000 patents atop his original basic one and meantime he had put in some of his hardest years trying to develop flying it was on his seventy-fifth birthday that he disclosed that he would not have a telephone in his own study and that there was no telephone in the cocoanut grove home of his daughter-in-law mrs fairchild in the miami suburb where he was spending the winter working toward fresh inventions dr bell went abroad the last time two years ago paying a farewell visit to his native edinburgh and returning to say that he had found himself a stranger in a strange land and that he was glad to get back to america where he had lived most of his life throughout his life dr bell maintained his interest in deaf mutes he founded the american association to promote teaching of speech to the deaf and contributed $250000 to its support he was a member of many of the leading american societies of learning',\n",
       " 'from his days as a player knute rockne made his influence felt on the trend of football as captain of the 1913 notre dame team he figured at end in the most successful exhibition of forward passing the game had seen up to that time; and from that date on the forward pass grew steadily to its present importance in the game as a coach he brought the shift play to its highest state of perfection and made it such an important factor in offensive football that the rules committee finally passed legislation designed to take some of its power away that shift development the back field hop was the most important of his contributions to the coaching of the game but he added others notably the reshaping of the line prior to rockne linemen were big men inevitably rockne brought the idea of using linemen particularly guards in interference and demonstrated that the small fast lineman could hold his own with the big man and outplay him where the big man was not as fast changed strategy of touchdown he worked for the perfection of a team as a whole and his last two teams won game after game through the successful application of what came to be called \"the perfect plays\" in these every individual carried out a part of the blocking and when no man failed to carry out his job the play often went for a touchdown this perfect play did a great deal to wipe away the idea of aiming first for scoring territory and then the score rockne always said that every play if perfectly carried out would go for a touchdown from wherever it was started his last two teams usually started their scoring with long runs from scrimmage in coaching he tried always for perfection and spent hours in teaching the art of blocking simple plays well executed were his idea of the way to win football games he had small use for any so-called trick plays there were only seven places in a line to send a man with a ball he said and there ought not to be many more than seven plays hard work was another of his slogans \"the best thing i ever learned in life\" he said last june during a visit to poughkeepsie for the intercollegiate boat race there \"was that things have to be worked for a lot of people seem to think there is some sort of magic in making a winning football team there isn\\'t but there plenty of work\" suddenly developed the pass as a player and captain of the 1913 notre dame team the first to ever beat the army rockne began his shaping of football destinies by bringing the forward pass suddenly and dramatically into the front of the game army that season had scheduled notre dame as a \"breather\" game on its schedule only a small crowd turned out and they stood amazed as notre dame defeated army 35 to 13 gus dorais now coach at detroit threw seventeen passes in that game and thirteen were completed and a great majority of these went to the short chunky end knute rockne the forward pass had been more or less of a haphazard thing until that time the success of this western team with it amazed the football world dorais and rockne remained behind at west point for a few days after that game to show the army how it was done one of the results of that was the famous pritchard to merrillat combination of army teams in that first success was an indication of the capacity for taking pains which rockne owned that game was the direct result of the summer before dorais and rockne had obtained vacation jobs together at a mid-west beach and included a football in their baggage all that summer they got out on the beach and threw passes the success against army was no accident it had been carefully planned remarkable record as coach as a coach of course rockne record is one of the most remarkable that any coach of any sport has ever piled up nearly all of his teams have been in the front rank of the game despite the fact that they always played hard schedules five of them were undefeated taking over the head coach job after helping instruct in the chemistry department of notre dame in 1918 rockne had almost immediate success his 1919 team was undefeated and his 1920 team was one of the greatest that he had to the game in general rockne brought the high development of the backfield shift and a new conception of line play he never claimed the invention of the shift play but there can be small argument with the idea that under him notre dame players brought it to its highest perfection so successful were his teams with the shift that three years ago the football rules committee fearing the offense of the game would overbalance the defense began ruling against it and this last year finally insisted that a full second in which an official might count five must come between the close of the shift and the start of the ball rockne never was reconciled to this and never lost an opportunity to defend his favorite style of play legislating against the shift he said was like taking the feinting out of boxing and leaving in only the slugging rockne organized coaching schools in which coaches might gather during the off seasons and study the methods of others he assisted with summer schools all over the country and in 1928 even conducted one at sea when he chartered a ship and took a party of coaches and athletes to the olympic games of that year developed famous players perhaps his greatest teams came in 1920 1924 1929 and 1930 on the first was george gipp who was named by rockne as the greatest player he ever had the coach told the story of seeing gipp who was not trying for the team throwing a ball and kicking on the campus and of inducing him to join the squad gipp died a few weeks after the close of the 1920 season of a throat infection with rockne at his bedside the 1924 team was the one of the famous four horsemen harry stuhldreher jimmy crowley don miller and elmer layden as a combination they have not been excelled in modern back fields and they had a great line in front of them led by the famous adam walsh at centre who is now assisting with the coaching at yale that team of the four horsemen won all over the country beating princeton at princeton with a temperature of 10 above zero and several weeks later journeying to the coast to defeat stanford in a temperature of 70 degrees the records and names of the members of the two recent teams are still fresh in memory frank carideo marchmont schwartz marty brill joe savoldi bucky o\\'connor moon mullins and the 1930 team came very near to being the best northwestern army and southern california were played on successive saturdays one saturday in chicago army was turned back in ice and cold rain and the following week the highly regarded southern california team was badly beaten on the coast provided coaches for nation if there were any doubt of the influence of rockne on football the list of head coaches for the past year might remove it there were throughout the country north south east and west twenty-three head coaches of football from notre dame without naming the assistants here and there notable among them are walsh and rip miller who has this year been elevated to head coach at navy the mere record of his work fails to bring out for those who did not know him the biting incisive clear-cut character and personality of the man dramatic in everything he did even to his death rockne became a sort of god to the boys who played for him a great talker a keen wit he had a balanced sane philosophy of life and a keen knowledge of psychology there are numerous instances in the near legends which have sprung up about him of his use of the latter element in dealing with his boys the year that army and navy played in chicago in 1926 he went to chicago to watch the game confident his strong team would beat carnegie tech without too much trouble in his absence they did not used the delayed criticism the coach returned to south bend the next week the team was to play on the pacific coast all week rockne coached without mentioning the defeat the players kept waiting for him to say something he did not but when they boarded the train and opened their baggage each player found a carefully clipped account of the lost game in his baggage they won on the coast this year before the army game rockne sat in the dressing room with his players waiting for the time to go out on the field the players sat silently waiting for him to say something the minutes ticked off in the quiet room and finally an official came to tell them to come out rockne nodded stood up and said \"come on boys\" that was all he has given words to the vocabulary of the sport as well some of which fit exactly the army of people who criticize the players and coaches after a defeat waiting until the day after to display their wisdom \"sunday morning coaches\" was rockne name for this class a polished story-teller and a constantly interesting companion rockne made friends wherever he went and was almost as much at home at the colleges he played against on his numerous visits as he was at his own at these places he will be greatly missed as a friend',\n",

it no use attempting anything more in the same direction one must seek new ideas\" mr ravel deliberately fashioned his musical style and followed his self-appointed path when he was asked about the need for a composer to write with sincerity he replied: \"i don\\'t particularly care about this incerity\\' i try to make art\" he illustrated his point by saying that he had worked on a violin and piano sonata for four years three of which were spent in taking out the notes that were not necessary began piano lessons at 12 mr ravel was born in ciboure near st jean-de-luz march 7 1875 his mother was of basque descent his father came of french and swiss people when he was 12 years old he was taken to paris for lessons in piano and theory two years later his serious training began when he entered the paris conservatory as a piano student in a few seasons his talent won him an honorary medal and entry to the advanced class of charles de beriot supplementing his piano work were his classes in harmony with emile pessard counterpoint and fugue with andre gedalge and composition with gabriel faure his own tastes led him to study the music of satie liszt chabrier and many of the russians principally rimsky-korsakoff all of whom exerted some influence upon his work but from the first as is revealed in his earliest known compositions his style was a personal one the first public hearings of his music were unfavorably reviewed by the few critics who paid attention to them that fact however set up the story that ravel was a dangerous political revolutionist--a story that spread to musical officialdom and seriously hindered the young composer early efforts at recognition thus having won the second place in the prix de rome in 1901 he tried unsuccessfully for the first prize in the following two years ruled ineligible by jury in 1905 the jury ruled him ineligible in the preliminary contest designed only to eliminate obviously incompetent candidates since his string quartet his \"pavane\" and \"jeux d\\'eau\" for piano had been performed and published this verdict was patently unfair important critics who had little sympathy with mr ravel music protested vigorously but as far as concerned the prix de rome in vain recognition of mr ravel gifts however was not slow in coming there was no ignoring early works like \"jeux d\\'eau\" 1901 \"gaspard de la nuit\" and the \"mother goose\" suite 1908 of later works the \"scheherazade\" \"alborada del gracioso\" \"rhapsodie espagnole\" and \"la valse\"--all for orchestra--were notable contributions other important works are the f major string quartet introduction and allegro for harp quartet flute and clarinet;

75000 volunteers young holmes 20 years old and shortly to be graduated from harvard with the class of \\'61 walked down beacon hill with an open hobbe \"leviathan\" in his hand and learned that he was commissioned in the twentieth massachusetts volunteers the regiment largely officered by young harvard men and later to be known as the \"harvard regiment\" was ordered south and into action at ball bluff there were grave tactical errors and the union troops were driven down the cliff on the virginia shore and into the potomac men trying to swim to safety were killed and wounded men were drowned lieutenant holmes with a bullet through his breast was placed in a boat with dying men and ferried through saving darkness to the maryland shore his wound was serious but the sufferer was young and storng for convalescence he was returned to boston on his recovery he returned to the front at antietam a bullet pierced his neck and again his condition was critical dr holmes on learning the news set out to search for his son the search lasted many worried days and brought the father close to the lines at several points he found his son already convalescent and brought him back to boston where he wrote his experiences under the title \"my hunt for the captain\" an article that was enthusiastically received as bringing home to boston a first-hand picture of the trials of war directly behind the lines wounded a third time back at the front the young officer was again wounded a bullet cut through tendons and lodged in his heel this wound was long in healing and holmes was retired to boston with the brevet ranks of colonel and major the emergency of war over his life was his own again there was the question then of what to do with it writing appealed to him he had been class poet and prize essayist in college but he finally turned to law although it was long before he was sure that he had taken the best course \"it cost me some years of doubt and unhappiness\" he said later \"before i could say to myself: \\'the law is part of the universe--if the universe can be thought about one part must reveal it as much as another to one who can see that part it is only a question if you have the eyes\\'\" philosophy and william james helped him find his legal eyes while he studied in harvard law school and james a year younger was studying medicine through long nights they discussed their \"dilapidated old friend the kosmos\" james later was to write in affectionate reminiscence of \"your whitely lit-up room drinking in your profound wisdom your golden jibes your costly imagery listening to your shuddering laughter\" but while james went on continuing in germany his search for the meanings of the universe holmes decided that \"maybe the universe is too great a swell to have a meaning\" that his task was to \"make his own universe livable\" and he drove deep into the study of the law he took his ll b in 1866 and went to europe to climb some mountains early in 1867 he was admitted to the bar and james noted that \"wendell is working too hard\" the hard work brought results in 1870 he was made editor of the american law review two years later on june 17 1872 he married fanny bowditch dixwell and in march of the next year became a member of the law firm of shattuck homes & munroe resigning his editorship but continuing to write articles for the review in that same year 1873 his important edition of kent commentaries appeared his papers particularly one on english equity which bristled with citations in latin and german showed that he was a master scholar where mastery meant labor and penetration it was into these early papers that he put the fundamentals of an exposition of the law that he was later to deliver in lowell lectures at harvard and to publish under the title \"the common law\" in this book to quote benjamin n cardozo he \"packed a whole philosophy of legal method into a fragment of a paragraph\" the part to which judge cardozo referred reads: \"the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience the felt necessities of the time the prevalent moral and political theories intuitions of public policy avowed or unconscious even with the prejudices which judges share with their follow-men have had a great deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed the law embodies the story of a nation development through many centuries and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics\" judge cardozo commenting on this wrote: \"the student of juristic method bewildered in a maze of precedents feels the thrill of a new apocalypse in the flash of this revealing insight here is the text to be unfolded all that is to come will be development and commentary flashes there are like this in his earlier manner as in his latest yet the flashes grow more frequent the thunder peals more resonant with the movement of the years\" makes his debut as judge holmes was only 39 years old when harvard called him back to teach in her law school and 41 when he became an associate justice on the massachusetts supreme court bench so in that great period when joseph h choate could call a federal income tax \"sheer communism\" the young massachusetts justice could with no bias write dozens of dissenting opinions in which he expressed views that since have been molded into law he was chief justice on the commonwealth bench when in 1901 theodore roosevelt noted that holmes \"labor decisions\" were criticized by \"some of the big railroad men and other members of large corporations\" oddly enough the successor of william mckinley thought that was \"a strong point in judge holmes favor\" in reference to this the president wrote to henry cabot lodge: \"the ablest lawyers and greatest judges are men whose past has naturally brought them into close relationship with the wealthiest and most powerful clients and i am glad when i can find a judge who has been able to preserve his aloofness of mind so as to keep his broad humanity of feeling and his sympathy for the class from which he has not drawn clients\" in further expression of this approval he in 1902 appointed judge holmes to the supreme court of the united states an appointment that was confirmed by the senate immediately and unanimously in a dissenting opinion written early in his career on the supreme bench justice holmes bluntly told his associates that the case in hand had been decided by the majority on an economic theory which a large part of the country did not entertain that general principles do not decide concrete cases that the outcome depends on a judgment or institution more subtle than any articulate major premise a great struggle between the forces of theodore roosevelt and the elder j p morgan began on march 10 1902 when the government filed suit in the united states circuit court for the district of minnesota charging that the great northern securities company was \"a virtual consolidation of two competing transcontinental lines\" whereby not only would \"monopoly of the interstate and foreign commerce formerly carried on by them as competitors be created\" but through use of the same machinery \"the entire railway systems of the country may be absorbed merged and consolidated\" in april 1903 the lower court decided for the government and 8000 pages of records and briefs went to the united states supreme court for final review on march 14 1904 the high court found for the government with justice holmes writing in dissent he held that the sherman act did not prescribe the rule of \"free competition among those engaged in interstate commerce\" as the majority held it merely forbade \"restraint of trade or commerce\" he asserted that the phrases \"restraint of competition\" and \"restraint of trade\" did not have the same meaning; that \"restraint of trade\" which had \"a definite and well-established significance in the common law means and had always been understand to mean a combination made by men engaged in a certain business for the purpose of keeping other men out of that business * * *\" the objection to trusts was not the union of former competitors but the sinister power exercised or supposed to be exercised by the combination in keeping rivals out of the business he said it was the ferocious extreme of competition with others not the cessation of competition among the partners which was the evil feared \"much trouble\" he continued \"is made by substituting other phrases assumed to be equivalent which are then argued from as if they were in the act the court below argued as if maintaining competition were the express purpose of the act the act says nothing about competition\" it was at this time that john morley visited america and returned to england with the affirmation that in justice homes america possessed the greatest judge of the english- speaking world time has reinforced the emphasis in his years on the supreme court bench he had done more to mold the texture of the constitution than any man since john marshall revealed to the american people what their new constitution might imply matthew arnold in his essay on the study of poetry says that the best way to separate the gold from the alloy in the coinage of the poets is by the test of a few lines carried in the thoughts excerpts from holmes writings from the opinions and other writings of justice holmes the following lines are some that might be used for this test: \"when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas--that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be carried out that at any rate is the theory of our constitution it is an experiment as all life is an experiment\" \"in the organic relations of modern society it may sometimes be hard to draw the line that is supposed to limit the authority of the legislature to exercise or delegate the power of eminent domain but to gather the streams from waste and to draw from them energy labor without brains and so to save mankind from toil that it can be spared is to supply what next to intellect is the very foundation of all our achievements and all our welfare if that purpose is not public we should be at a loss to say what is\" \"the fourteenth amendment does not enact mr herbert spencer social statics\" \"while the courts must exercise a judgment of their own it by no means is true that every law is void which may seem to the judges who pass upon it excessive unsuited to its ostensible end or based upon conceptions of morality with which they disagree considerable latitude must be allowed for difference of view as well as for possible peculiar conditions which this court can know but imperfectly if at all otherwise a constitution instead of embodying only relatively fundamental rules of right as generally understood by all english-speaking communities would become the partisan of a particular set of ethical or economic opinions which by no means are held semper ubique et ab omnibus\" his contribution to american life was not limited to the law he lived as he advised others to live in the \"grand manner\" he sought quality rather than quantity of experience and knowledge of his success in living helped others to find it too on his ninetieth birthday he delivered a short radio speech in reply to tributes from chief justice hughes and other leaders of the american bar from a latin poet he quoted the words: \"death plucks my ears and says \\'live--i am coming\\'\" and in one line he gave the core of a life philosophy: \"to live is to function; that is all there is to living\" left bench jan 12 1932 justice holmes resigned on jan 12 1932 \"the time has now come and i bow to the inevitable\" he wrote to the president he left amid national regret almost thirty years after he had been appointed to the supreme court bench soon after that in a message to the federal bar association justice holmes wrote: \"i cannot say farewell to life and you in formal words life seems to me like a japanese picture which our imagination does not allow to end with the margin we aim at the infinite and when our arrow falls to earth it is in flames \"at times the ambitious ends of life have made it seem to me lonely but it has not been you have given me the companionship of dear friends who have helped to keep alive the fire in my heart if i could think that i had sent a spark to those who come after i should be ready to say good-bye\" justice holmes was an honorary member of the honourable society of lincoln inn london to which also belonged such men as oliver cromwell william pitt benjamin disraeli and william ewart gladstone soon after retiring his salary was cut in two by reason of the economy law it was restored to $20000 a year a few months later however by special action of the senate in the fall of 1931 appeared the \"representative opinions of mr justice holmes\" mrs holmes died on april 30 1929',\n",

a training flight and also killed col vladimir s seryogin described as chief of the detachment both victims will be buried in the kremlin wall the radio bulletin added the radio said the cosmonaut who was 34 years old died while test-flying a new aircraft the official announcement as carried by tass the soviet press agency said: \"it is officially announced here that hero of the soviet union yuri gagarin the world first cosmonaut has perished during an air crash\" colonel gagarin made man first flight in space on april 12 1961 a one-orbit trip lasting 108 minutes tass said the announcement of colonel gagarin death had been made by the communist party central committee the presidium of the supreme soviet parliament and the soviet council of ministers from obscurity to renown until the morning of april 12 1961 yuri alekseyevich gagarin was no better known than any of the other 1200 or so gagarins living in the moscow area but that morning yuri gagarin then 27 years old sat cramped in the cockpit of a vostok space capsule as it was launched from a pad at baykonur in kazakhstan at 9:07 am the capsule went into orbit around the earth and yuri gagarin became the world first man in space his flight represented an epochal scientific and technological achievement for the russians in both the soviet union and the west it was realized that cosmonaut gagarin had begun a new chapter in history one in which man had dared cross the threshold of the universe setback for us the gagarin flight was a blow to those involved in that united states space program as well as a political and diplomatic setback a fact underlined by the soviet union trumpeting of the feat as evidence of \"the genius of the soviet people and the powerful force of socialism\" the formerly unknown test pilot was transformed into an international hero streets were named for him in many soviet cities monuments were erected and government officials pinned medals on his tunic premier nikita krushchev publicly smothered him with kisses compared him to christopher columbus and named him a hero of the soviet union yuri gagarin was a rather quiet man mild-spoken almost to a fault he had intelligent dark eyes and bushy eyebrows his forehead was broad and his nose snubbed and persons who knew him said he had the appearance and demeanor of \"a typical muskovite\" he was born march 9 1934 on a collective farm near gzhatsk in the state of smolenskaya about 100 miles from moscow his father aleksei was a carpenter and his mother anna worked in the fields the name gagarin which derives from the russian word for \"wild duck\" was that of an ancient princely family that held vast estates in the smolensk area before the bolshevik revolution but the cosmonaut angrily denied any connection with that aristocratic lineage in invaders\\' path the first seven years of the boy life were spent peacefully on the collective farm but the peace was shattered when the germans attacked russia in june 1941 gzhatsk was directly on the historic invasion path to moscow and by late september nazi panzer tanks had overrun it the elder gagarin is believed to have gone into the army while his wife and three children fled eastward ahead of the nazis the family returned to ghatsk from exile in the urals when the war ended and yuri was sent to an industrial school in a moscow suburb the boy fell in love with airplanes and went to every air show over a period of five years held in nearby tushino he was graduated with distinction from the industrial school and while working as a molder attended night school for workers and completed secondary school studies while studying for a technical degree at saratov he learned to fly with the local aero club met wife at school in 1957 colonel gagarin graduated from an air force cadet school at orenburg where he met his wife valentina a graduate of the orenburg medical school soon after his marriage he began a tour of duty as a fighter pilot as a senior lieutenant he was in the first group of pilots to be trained for space flights on the eve of the vostok flight he was promoted to major and at the time of his death was a full colonel after his great leap forward into space he did not make a second space flight but it is understood he played a major part in training pilots for future flights colonel gagarin space vehicle was a rocket-propelled five-ton satellite after attaining the first escape velocity and the separation of the last stage of the carrier rocket the spaceship went into free flight that circled the earth only once the ship made the trip in 891 minutes and then returned to earth safely after a total flight time of 108 minutes the cosmonaut bailed out before the capsule hit the ground in the wastelands of baikonur since that flight both russian and american astronauts have gone on to greater achievements including multimanned multiple-orbit flights but gagarin was man first flight in space and history will remember him for it his heroism was applauded on an international tour and he rose in the ranks of the communist party which he had joined in 1949 colonel gagarin served as chairman of the soviet-cuban friendship society and as a delegate to the 22d congress of the communist party since 1962 he had served as a deputy in the supreme soviet he is survived by his wife and two

leadership conference died yesterday at the crawford w long hospital of emory university in atlanta he was 64 years old the hospital issued a statement explaining that mr abernathy who had been in poor health in recent years and had been hospitalized since march 23 was undergoing a lung scan yesterday morning when his blood pressure dropped and his heart stopped beating he was given emergency treatment and placed on a cardiopulmonary support system doctors planned emergency surgery but mr abernathy died at 12:10 pm late yesterday the white house issued a statement from president bush that said ''barbara and i join with all americans to mourn the passing of the rev ralph abernathy a great leader in the struggle for civil rights for all americans and a tireless campaigner for justice'' the king-abernathy friendship started in the early 1950 and continued until dr king assassination on april 4 1968 in memphis mr abernathy was with him that day and cradled his bloody head as dr king lay mortally wounded on a balcony of the lorraine motel mr abernathy then took care of some details of the funeral and delivered the eulogy for his friend the two had marched together addressed friendly and hostile audiences together faced violence together and on many an occasion gone to jail together successor to dr king after dr king death mr abernathy took over the leadership of the southern christian leadership conference which he ran for nine years many of the conference leaders had misgivings but dr king had wanted it that way he had always praised mr abernathy help and mr abernathy consistently said that he did not mind being in dr king shadow and that the two were never rivals and yet there were accusations in 1989 that mr abernathy had abused dr king trust the complaints came from prominent leaders in the civil rights movement after publication of mr abernathy autobiography ''and the walls came tumbling down'' in which he wrote that dr king had been an adulterer mr abernathy said he had not revealed anything that had not already been discussed publicly ''had others not dealt with the matter in such detail i might have avoided any commentary'' he wrote he also said that although he personally did not approve of dr king behavior he understood its reasons because both he and dr king were away from home so much the rev joseph lowery who succeeded mr abnernathy as president of the southern christian leadership conference said yesterday that he regretted the things mr abernathy had said about dr king in the book but praised mr abernathy ''as a stalwart steward'' in the civil rights struggle and called him ''a faithful servant of the cause of liberty and justice'' remembrance by young andrew young former mayor of atlanta and now a candidate for governor of georgia was a civil rights worker in the 1960 who knew mr abernathy well mr young said yesterday that mr abernathy would be remembered as one who performed ''a silent labor that was very much needed'' and as a ''jovial profound loving preacher who gave his life in the service of others'' one of dr king two sons martin luther king 3d called mr abernathy death ''a very tragic loss to our nation'' the autobiography was not the first time mr abernathy had been involved in disputes with colleagues in the civil rights movement one of his most notable adversaries was dr king widow coretta scott king in 1978 he took issue with the script of a six-hour television ''docudrama'' on dr king life he called it ''a distortion of history'' because it did not give proper credit to various conference leaders but mrs king strongly disagreed with him and said the drama was a faithful portrait of the man and the movement in 1980 mr abernathy again became the focus of controversy when he endorsed ronald reagan campaign for the presidency several black leaders assailed his judgment and mrs king distanced herself from mr abernathy calling mr reagan a ''war hawk'' who ''lacked distinction even as an actor'' but mr abernathy said he had received assurances from mr reagan that blacks would be appointed to high posts in a reagan administration endorsement of reagan the reagan endorsement came at the end of a decade of some difficulty for mr abernathy he left the presidency of the sclc in 1977 at a time when the group had fallen into debt and critics said it no longer sparked the imagination of blacks as it had when it was run by dr king but if mr abernathy was criticized as too conservative disorganized wedded to the techniques of the past and lacking dr king charisma and gift of oratory he continued to win praise for his contributions to the early days of the civil rights struggle and to dr king success in leading it some said dr king could not have triumphed as he did without mr abernathy help mr abernathy and dr king served as pastors of different baptist churches in montgomery they met in atlanta in the early 1950 in the ebenezer baptist church whose minister was dr king father the rev martin luther king sr bus boycott in montgomery mr abernathy became pastor of the first baptist church of montgomery in 1951 a few years later dr king was named pastor of the dexter avenue baptist church in atlanta they became fast friends and found that they agreed on what was needed if blacks were to progress: a consistent nonviolent effort that would have broad appeal not only to the blacks it was trying to help but also to whites together they organized a boycott of buses in montgomery in 1955 after rosa parks a black seamstress was arrested because she refused to give up her seat to a white person the organization that directed the boycott was the montgomery improvement association through its auspices blacks began to use car pools or walk to wherever they had to go rather than patronize segregated public transportation dr king was its president and mr abernathy an important aide in the years that followed the boycott which helped achieve the integratio they sought dr king and mr abernathy went to jail together 17 times as a result of demonstrations they led from selma ala to albany ga mr abernathy along with hosea williams bernard lee andrew young james bevel jesse jackson and others were mainstays of the conference which was established by dr king in 1957 to promote peaceful integration in the south mr williams who was mobilization director of the conference said he thought of dr king and mr abernathy as ''the greatest team'' observing ''martin wouldn't make a decision without him'' fighters for civil rights in the south were no strangers to violence in 1957 a year after a federal court issued an injunction that gave blacks and whites equal status on buses a decision upheld by the united states supreme court mr abernathy home and church were bombed he and his family were not harmed but the church was destroyed in 1961 dr king asked mr abernathy to resign his pastor job to devote all his energy to the southern christian leadership conference mr abernathy served it as vice president at large a job he kept until dr king death ''we're going to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that you can kill the dreamer but you cannot kill the dream'' he said but the conference was not able to maintain its influence and power as it had when dr king was alive grandson of a slave the grandson

       " 'the story of adolph s ochs is one of a career which in poverty and wealth in obscurity and eminence was all of one piece the qualities that his employers and associates noted when he began his newspaper career as office boy and printer devil in knoxville tenn were the qualities he manifested throughout his life the principles he announced and put into practice when at the age of 20 he took charge of a bankrupt small-town newspaper were the principles he announced and put into practice eighteen years later when he took charge of the bankrupt new york times and carried it to influence and prosperity he knew how to publish he believed in publishing only one single kind of paper; and his great achievement was the proof that the publishing of that kind of paper--\"clean dignified trustworthy and impartial\" as he phrased it in his announcement in the times on aug 18 1896--was practically possible; was not an exercise in altruism but could be made economically as well as ethically successful that he made it successful was due no doubt to native ability to a mind which strong in its grasp of organization also was unusually intuitional and in flashes of inspiration covered in an instant ground that slow-thinking men might labor over for months; but also very largely to the fact that he learned the newspaper business from the ground up was in it all his life and never wasted his time or his ambitions on outside enterprises or on the political aspirations that have proved a curse to so many other newspaper makers not least to his predecessor henry j raymond founder of the new york times the poverty of his parents cut short his formal schooling; but as he told the national editorial association in its convention of 1916 the printing office was his high school and university and something of the impress of the old-time printing shop and of that unique and salty breed the old-school printers stayed with him all his life principles learned at home but the principles were his before he learned how to put them into practice; he learned them at home he was born in cincinnati march 12 1858 eldest of the six children of julius and bertha levy ochs both his parents belonged to the group of german liberals and intellectuals who had been driven from home by the repressive measures of autocratic governments against which the revolution of 1848 was an ineffectual protest julius ochs born in furth bavaria in 1826 came to the united states at the age of 18 possessor of an excellent education and fluent in six languages-- german french english spanish italian and hebrew he taught languages in various southern schools a career only briefly interrupted by his volunteering for the mexican war as his regiment was never called into active service in natchez in 1853 he met miss levy and they were married in nashville two years later adolph ochs mother born in rhenish bavaria of a family with distinguished connections in france and alsace had had to leave germany in haste in 1848 to escape arrest for her connection with revolutionary committees she traveled by sailing ship to new orleans where an uncle lived the influence of this brilliant and cultured woman on her son was immense and lasting at the age of 70 his telegram of congratulation to alfred e smith on his nomination to the presidency took this characteristic form: \"every good mother son is inspired and encouraged by this well-earned climax to an extraordinary career\" until she moved to cincinnati after her marriage mrs ochs american residence had been in the south; her sympathies were with the south in the civil war that presently broke out and her brother served in the confederate army julius ochs however despite his southern connections and his residence in kentucky and tennessee was a union man; he enlisted in an ohio regiment in 1861 and served throughout the war rising to the rank of captain the division in politics did not affect the harmony of the family; but when captain ochs died in chattanooga in 1888 the grand army of the republic was prominent at his funeral; when his wife died in new york in 1910 a similar part was played by the daughters of the confederacy family moves to knoxville after the war captain ochs found himself in the position of a good many demobilized soldiers; he had to start again from the beginning with his growing family he moved to knoxville tenn a town that had been somewhat battered in the war but seemed to have bright prospects for future growth that expectation was justified; but julius ochs scholar and idealist lacked the talent for material success that would have enabled him to share in the town prosperity he served as justice of the peace and united states commissioner and later for a short time as probate judge; his continuing enthusiasm for clean and progressive politics in an age when such ideas had fallen out of favor carried him as a delegate to the liberal republican convention which nominated greeley in cincinnati in 1872 active in lodge work he was universally popular and respected; deeply pious and a student of the religious writings of the hebrew faith he served his unorganized co-religionists in knoxville as what one of the tennessee friends later called \"a first-class emergency rabbi\" but his material fortunes did not prosper and his sons grew up in the realization that as soon as possible they must begin to contribute to the family income adolph the oldest boy went to work at the age of 11 as office boy to captain william rule editor of the knoxville chronicle this republican paper successor of parson brownlow knoxville whig of pre-war days never succeeded in winning its newest employe to its politics; adolph ochs grew up in sympathy with the conservative democrats of the reconstruction period but captain rule became one of the determining influences of his life and inspired a loyalty and affection that was enduring fifty-two years later when all knoxville declared a holiday to celebrate the eighty- second birthday of captain rule--then and until his death in his ninetieth year still in active service as an editor--the publisher of the new york times was a sort of secondary guest of honor; and captain rule recalled that \"he swept my sanctum and cleaned up the papers and trash so methodically that he was promoted to delivery boy\" getting up long before dawn to deposit the chronicle on the doorsteps of subscribers for $150 a week after a year or so of this the family decided that the boy might have a better chance in a larger city so he was sent to providence ri where his mother two brothers had a grocery in which he worked as cash boy but the next year he was back in knoxville working in a local drug store where tradition has it he lost his job some six months later by selling a customer borax in mistake for sal soda early in 1872 he returned to the chronicle this time as printer devil--the old-time printer term for the boy who did the odd jobs and dirty work about the composing room; and this established him in the newspaper business where he was to remain for the rest of his life keen in quest of knowledge in the chaotic conditions of a town recovering from the civil war through the handicaps of reconstruction it would be hard to say whether a boy worked outside of school hours or went to school outside of working hours adolph ochs had got the beginnings of his school education at bradford hampden-sydney academy a knoxville day school and during his next three years in the chronicle composing room he attended classes when he could in the preparatory department of the east tennessee university now the university of tennessee where he impressed his teachers as he impressed his employers with his diligence and quickness the few years he actually spent in a schoolroom might not have amounted to much however had it not been for what he learned outside; as an office boy a carrier a grocery or drug store clerk he was always asking questions-- an acquaintance of those days described him as \"a human interrogation point\"; and the deficiencies of his formal education were compensated by the advantages of a cultured home and the private tuition of a scholarly father there remained the printing office his high school and university as he later described it; but the thorough grounding in the newspaper business which he got in the knoxville chronicle shop came to him largely by accident when the 13-year-old boy became a printer devil he still had no idea of making the newspaper business his life work; he went after the job because he needed the money and was hired because his services as office boy and carrier had impressed the editor of the chronicle with his trustworthiness now it happened that the printer devil had to work at night and that his duties were finished earlier than those of the journeyman printers who were the aristocracy of the composing room he had to go home alone and the way home along unpaved poorly lighted streets led past the graveyard of the first presbyterian church a boy of 13 who had grown up in a town where there were plenty of superstitious residents both white and colored might be excused for sometimes forgetting the information he had no doubt received at home that a graveyard was nothing to be afraid of he hated to go home alone in the dark; and because the foreman of the composing room henry c collins lived near him little adolph ochs used to stay in the shop after his own day work was over till mr collins had finished and could walk home with him staying in the shop he had to occupy his time and the natural way to do it was by learning more about the printing trade than would come the way even of an alert and observant printer devil during his ordinary and well-filled working hours he learned and he learned fast; and in later years the proprietor of the new york times was not ashamed to admit that what really made a newspaper man of him was the need of company when he walked past the graveyard late at night half a century later when mr ochs returned to knoxville for the rule celebration he and mr collins went over that route again most of the landmarks had vanished but the friendship that sprang up in the composing room still endured those years as devil and later apprentice were busy ones for young adolph ochs; learning his trade in the printing office going to school as he found opportunity and acting as usher with his younger brothers george and milton in mayor peter staub opera house where traveling companies played \"the two orphans\" \"monte cristo\" and \"hazel kirke\" and ushers picked up a little extra money by selling candy between the acts starts out in wider field and so it went till october 1875 when adolph ochs 17 years old decided to go out and see what he could do in a larger field there is a tradition that he had some idea of settling eventually in california but his immediate objective was louisville; and the letters of recommendation that he took with him when he left his home town were considered more than perfunctory discharges of obligation; they were curiously prophetic captain rule the editor of the chronicle wrote that he had found him \"honest zealous reliable and trustworthy * * * quick to comprehend and faithful to execute\" and \"endowed with an intellect capable of reaching the highest point of mental achievement\" collins his foreman said that \"he is to a foreman what money is to a miser--a necessity hard to part with\" his associates in the composing room presented him with a volume of hood poems--he kept it all his life--with an inscription on the flyleaf over all their signatures expressing the hope that \"some day we shall be able to note you among the nation honored sons\" and mayor staub losing a valuable usher from his opera house chose to speak in his civic rather than his private capacity: \"for the mayor of any city such a loss as your departure my young and worthy friend is quite serious\" armed with these testimonials the young printer went to louisville and found work in the job printing department of the courier journal but six months later he was back in knoxville; and as edward h edwards a printer who worked with him there has put it \"if there ever was a turning point in the life of adolph s ochs it was when having gone out from his father roof to seek his fortune he so sorely felt the loss of family ties and the personal contact of those near and dear to him that he was impelled to return home\" ambition as well as homesickness was a motive however; a new paper the tribune had just been established in knoxville and it offered perhaps a better opportunity to a boy who was indeed trusted and admired by his old employers on the chronicle but might never have lived down the fact that he started at the very bottom might never have seemed to them any more than adolph the office boy grown up\" attracted by chattanooga his year and a half on the tribune gave him a more varied experience he worked at first in the composing room then as a reporter and was presently made assistant to the business manager franc m paul--a rehearsal in each of the three departments of newspaper-making which he was soon to find invaluable for already his ambitions and those of some of his associates on the tribune were looking southward to chattanooga the strategic importance of this city so great in the military operations of the civil war had not yet been appreciated commercially; the centre of a number of railroads with rich mineral deposits lying in the mountains roundabout chattanooga had only some 12000 people and was still in spirit a small town yet there were a few persons including adolph ochs who realized its possibilities; and this town of promise was served by only a single newspaper the times an organ miserably inadequate from every point of view which was living from hand to mouth young ochs and colonel j e macgowan an editorial writer on the knoxville tribune were planning to establish a new paper in competition with the chattanooga times when they discovered that their colleague franc paul had anticipated them and started the chattanooga dispatch to which he brought them both in the fall of 1877 colonel macgowan as editor and adolph ochs as advertising solicitor but the chattanooga times feeble as it was refused to fold up in the face of competition the outcome has been succinctly described by william m stone a chattanooga printer who was afterward for many years on mr ochs staff: \"in less than six months the dispatch despite paul planting and adolph watering proved a hopeless failure but this unfortunate as it seemed at the time proved a great blessing to chattanooga as it left adolph so poor that he could not leave town\" paul went back to knoxville colonel macgowan stayed in chattanooga and got another job and adolph ochs was made receiver of the dispatch and eventually managed to liquidate its debts but meanwhile he had to eat; and discovering that chattanooga had no city directory he set to work on this his first publication he himself did all the work on it but the binding; he got the information wrote it set it up in type read the proof and printed it on a hand press and this directory had two consequences besides the urgent and immediate one of enabling its publisher to eat--it gave him a comprehensive and thorough acquaintance with all the population and all the business of chattanooga and it awakened the citizens to the realization that their town had possibilities that they had overlooked but which were plain to the eyes of an observant and hungry young immigrant from knoxville takes over the local times the directory not only made ochs acquainted with chattanooga but made chattanooga acquainted with ochs the times had been able to outlast the competition of the dispatch; but it was about ready to give up the ghost and its editor offered to sell it to mr ochs for $800 provided he would assume the paper debts amounting to $1500 more the young man from knoxville would have been glad to accept the offer but for one insuperable difficulty: he did not have $800 indeed he had almost nothing; but he had made acquaintances and established his personal standing in chattanooga and after further negotiations he discovered that he could borrow $250 with that borrowed $250 he bought a half interest in the chattanooga times stipulating that his half should carry with it the control of the paper; he assumed the paper $1500 debt in addition to the $250 he had borrowed to buy it; and with his own private fortune of $3750 as working capital he became publisher of the chattanooga times on july 2 1878 the salutatory of the new publisher announced the theme around which his whole life was to be woven the times intended to become \"the indispensable organ of the business commercial and productive of chattanooga and of the mineral and agricultural districts\" surrounding the town; it would get all the news it could at home and abroad the earlier times had had no telegraph news at all and would support conservative democratic principles while reserving independence in state politics \"being cognizant of the need of and the strongly expressed desire for such a newspaper in chattanooga as the above outline indicates the times to be we have taken the people at their word and shall give them a chance to support that which they have been asking for\" but it was added \"in this matter of patronage we shall make no appeals but rely upon that sense of propriety and justice which must teach every intelligent citizen that the obligation between himself and the paper is a mutual one ours to print and circulate such a journal as we have described his to see that he contributes his share in proportion to the benefits such a paper confers on him as a citizen the means to sustain it and promote its growth * * * in short we shall conduct our business on business principles neither seeking nor giving sops and donations\" task a formidable one chattanooga knew what this meant the chattanooga times before mr ochs day had in the words of henry m wiltse \"dragged itself from pillar to post and had to lean heavily against the one or the other whenever it desired to cast a shadow or take a long breath\" it was a failing not uncommon in the small-town journalism of the seventies a precarious trade whose practitioners unless they were unusually able or unusually lucky were likely to find that they could keep afloat only by giving sops to local interests or by accepting donations of one sort or another which were rarely disinterested the young man who had turned his back on this sort of thing who had announced that he would give chattanooga what he thought it needed and would accept from it only what he thought he had earned had nothing behind him but his abilities and his knowledge of his trade he had been a resident of the town for less than a year despite the mustache which he then wore to give himself an air of maturity he could hardly conceal from his fellow-citizens that he was not yet old enough to vote he had a newspaper plant fit for hardly anything but the junk heap publishing a four-page paper with a circulation of 250; he owed $1750 and his working capital amounted to just about 2 per cent of his debts yet from that slender beginning came not only the chattanooga times but the new york times of today colonel macgowan another immigrant from knoxville left behind after the collapse of the dispatch was hired to serve as editor of the times in such time as he could spare from his other job at a salary of a dollar a day there was one reporter and a business office staff of one; five men in the composing room besides a foreman who also acted as proofreader and pressman; and the proprietor and publisher besides being general editorial supervisor was also business manager and advertising solicitor the payroll even of this modest force even in those times was somewhat over $100 a week without allowing any compensation for the publisher; and the problem of meeting the payroll in the first year was often an acute one but it was always met and met without any compromise with the principles announced by the new publisher in his first issue his first year with the chattanooga times was perhaps the hardest certainly the most critical in mr ochs whole career; but the end of the year saw him on the road to success profits put into business his total receipts that year were $12000; but his expenses were only $10000 including $900 withdrawn for his own living and the profit was plowed back into the business from the first he had given the times the telegraph service of the old western associated press; this was expanded as rapidly as possible and colonel macgowan was soon engaged as full-time editor a post he held until his death twenty-five years later when it became apparent that the new venture was going to be successful the publisher brought his family down from knoxville and his brothers george and milton presently took their turn as reporters on the times thus beginning newspaper careers that were later to bring distinction to both two years after he had bought the control of the times mr ochs was able to buy the other half interest in the paper that had been beyond his reach in 1878 at that time he could have bought it for $400 or probably even less; by 1880 he had to pay $5500 for it every cent of the increment in value being the result of his own success with the paper the newspaper which was thus succeeding was fulfilling its promise of impartiality and disinterestedness to l g walker on his appointment as editor of the chattanooga times years later mr ochs said: \"your only policy is to have no policy--no policy that is except to be right\" it was on that principle that the times was conducted from the very first in a day when newspapers especially in the smaller cities were far more likely to be affected by outside influence than they are at present; and it was that same principle that mr ochs later put into practice in new york but it never meant a weak policy or an absence of policy it meant independence and a sense of civic duty the chattanooga paper prospered and the town prospered with it in the language of william m stone mr ochs \"took the dirty poverty-stricken village by the nape of the neck and by sheer force of magnetic optimism and courageous enterprise lifted it to where it is today\" one of his own contributions to the upbuilding of the city was the erection in 1892 of the substantial building of the chattanooga times captain rule years before had noted that his young employe was not only honest but zealous; and it was that zeal that chattanooga was feeling now--the zeal of a young man who had picked out a town that he thought had a future and was resolved to make that future a pleasant reality there was no civic improvement of those years in chattanooga that the times did not promote--indeed often it started them--the opera house the firemen fountain the dredging of a channel in the tennessee river more important perhaps was the chickamauga national park of which mr ochs was one of the originators and which served to get him started in the park movement which was to prove one of the great interests of his life his only public office it was perhaps this zeal for promotion of his home town that led him to accept the only public office he ever held in his life--membership on the chattanooga school board in 1884 and 1885 mr ochs leadership in the boosting of his home town had a number of consequences one of which was not altogether pleasant chattanooga was flourishing largely because of the vigorous work of the times; and in 1888 the town paid the inevitable penalty of a real estate boom the publisher of the times later admitted that he ran wild like everybody else and bought up a lot of land which for years afterward ate its head off in taxes; but the boom turned out to be only an anticipation of values that were really there and ultimately mr ochs lost no money by this demonstration of his faith in chattanooga another by-product of mr ochs civic leadership had more agreeable and as it turned out more fruitful consequences by common consent the publisher of the times young affable and abundantly enthusiastic was accepted as the unofficial reception and entertainment committee for distinguished visitors to the town he was the better able to discharge this function since he had been married in cincinnati on feb 28 1883 to miss effie miriamwise daughter of the rev dr isaac m wise founder of the hebrew union college and the union of american hebrew congregations marriage brought him not only an invaluable helpmate but a brilliant connection in the early days when the whole ochs family was collaborating in getting out the chattanooga times mrs ochs did her part as book reviewer and dramatic critic besides presiding over the household at which eminent visitors to chattanooga were entertained to this union was born some years later a daughter iphigene bertha who was married in 1917 to arthur hays sulzberger all sorts of people passed through chattanooga in the later eighties and earlier nineties and the publisher of the times met most of them there was president cleveland; there were governors senators bankers bishops and railroad presidents a young republican editor from ohio named warren g harding came to town on his honeymoon and confessed to the publisher of the times that he wasn\\'t satisfied with his prospects back home and had some idea of starting a republican paper in chattanooga this notion was promptly dropped when mr ochs pointed out to him that the only republicans in chattanooga were colored people few of whom in those days could read casual remark prophetic another caller in 1890 was harry alloway a wall street reporter for the new york times who was writing a series of articles on the industrial development of the south to whom mr ochs remarked casually that he thought the times then in the beginnings of decay offered the greatest opportunity in american journalism this remark was forgotten by the young publisher; but harry alloway remembered it and the rehabilitation of the new york times was the fruit of that passing comment the outcome of all this entertainment of distinguished visitors unintended but inevitable was that the publisher of the chattanooga times was acquiring a national acquaintance far larger than falls to most small-city publishers and the time was at hand when he would find it useful in his trade too he was becoming widely and favorably known invited to address the meeting of the national editorial association at st paul in 1891 he put his finger on the great change american journalism was undergoing at the time and foretold the tendency of the future through the mid-nineteenth century the great papers had been essentially political and essentially personal; they were the platforms on which great editors could display their personal brilliance and the news columns were usually as biased and argumentative as the editorial page but mr ochs told the assembled editors at st paul: \"the day of the organ if not past is rapidly passing a journal conducted as a newspaper with the emphasis on the news is the newspaper of the future\" many newspapers of the south the chattanooga times included were at that time getting their telegraph news from the old associated press an illinois corporation composed chiefly of middle western newspapers with the new york world as its principal eastern member in opposition the other new york papers were maintaining at heavy cost the old united press southern papers were not altogether satisfied with the service they were getting and in 1891 mr ochs as secretary of the southern press association called a meeting which organized the southern associated press of which he became general manager and later chairman of the executive committee but the division of newspaper territory among three competing organizations did not prove successful; in 1894 the majority of southern papers threw in their lot with the united press mr ochs thought that the western organization had a better prospect of surviving the struggle than the eastern; the chattanooga times went into the associated press and the connections there formed were presently to prove of immense value to its publisher and to the greater enterprise which he was about to undertake as well as the associated press itself his first call to new york early in 1896 mr ochs received a telegram from a friend in new york--leopold wallach a lawyer--informing him that \"the opportunity of your life lies before you\" to an ambitious young man of 38 who had already explored and realized on about all the opportunities that were offered in chattanooga the information was too alluring to be overlooked; mr ochs went to new york to see what it was all about the reality was disillusioning this great opportunity was only the business managership of the new york mercury a small paper dealing chiefly in theatrical and sporting news which a group of politicians who favored free silver were planning to buy in order to give new york a silver newspaper in the presidential campaign of 1896 in which it was already evident that the currency issue would play a large part mr ochs however was a believer in the gold standard which the chattanooga times was valiantly supporting even though the majority of southern democrats had abandoned it with the management of a silver paper in new york or elsewhere he would have nothing to do; but when the silver group presently gave up its plan to buy the mercury the owner of that paper anxious to get rid of it before it died on his hands offered to sell it to mr ochs direct this was rather more of a temptation mr ochs believed that in new york at the time there was an opening for a compact paper devoting itself strictly to the presentation of news and selling at 1 cent a price then represented in new york only by the flamboyant \"yellow\" papers of the time the world and the journal the paper he envisioned was very much the sort of thing that another ambitious young man alfred harmsworth was just then beginning to publish in london; and it was mr ochs notion that the mercury could be developed into what he had in mind but all depended on the mercury continuing to receive as it was then receiving the service of the united press and when he found that its owner could give him no assurance of that mr ochs returned to chattanooga hardly had he reached home before he had a telegram--on his thirty-eighth birthday as it happened--from that harry alloway of the new york times to whom he had remarked six years before that the times offered the greatest opportunity in american journalism since 1890 the times had sadly declined there was talk of an imminent reorganization and alloway--purely on his own account and without any authority--wired to mr ochs that if he were interested in the times it could probably be bought cheap in mr ochs early years in new york rumor kept insisting that he had been brought to town by various personages from president cleveland on down to rehabilitate the times; but the fact is that the only man who \"brought him to town\" was the times reporter who wanted to see the paper set on its feet and believed that the chattanooga publisher had the ability to do it at the moment mr ochs did not take the idea very seriously; but it happened that the next day business took him to chicago there at lunch he mentioned the matter to his friend herman kohlsaat publisher of the chicago times-herald who exclaimed \"ochs there your opportunity\" \"but\" mr ochs protested \"i don\\'t believe i\\'m a big enough man for the job\" this argument failed to impress mr kohlsaat \"don\\'t tell anybody\" he advised \"and they\\'ll never find it out\" becomes interested in the times thus encouraged mr ochs went to new york and began to investigate the situation which was to prove not only his opportunity but the times too george jones who had joined with henry j raymond in founding the new york times in 1851 and had conducted it since raymond death had died in 1891 the antiquated organism which he knew how to operate his children were unable to conduct successfully and within two years of his death his heirs were prepared to save themselves further losses by selling the times to anybody who would pay the price as it turned out only one purchaser was willing to pay the $1000000 they asked for nothing but the paper name and good-will--a company hastily organized by the editors of the paper with all the money they had themselves and all they could get from their friends to prevent an institution of great and honorable tradition from falling into unworthy hands the company thus established under the presidency of charles r miller editor of the times since 1883 never had a fair chance to get started almost at once the panic of 1893 struck a paper which had no working capital and the only marvel is that the organization managed to keep going for three years longer by the spring of 1896 the circulation of the times had dwindled to 9000 the paper was printing 19000 copies a day but more than one-half of them were coming back unsold; it had outstanding obligations of $300000 and was losing $1000 a day mr miller a brilliant scholar thinker and stylist but no business man who would never have tried to be anything but an editor except under the pressure of necessity had endeavored to interest other new york editors and newspaper managers in the rescue of the times but these men who were on the spot who knew all the details of the situation were of the unanimous opinion that it could not be done a plan of reorganization-- involving of course the raising of more money to be thrown into what began to look like a bottomless pit--was being formulated by charles r flint and spencer trask already heavily involved in the times company; but it was generally recognized that what the plan needed was a man to work it and every man in new york who might have been supposed to see in the times the opportunity of his life had declared the thing was impossible a momentous interview in this situation the young publisher from chattanooga came to town and through alloway arranged an interview with the editor and president of the times mr miller hard driven and worried had so little hope of finding a solution for his troubles in this encounter that he arranged for a meeting at his home and decided to squeeze it in between dinner and a trip to the theatre on which he had promised to take his wife and children to forget the troubles that the times had brought down on their heads but it needed only a few minutes to make it clear to the editor that as fraser bond puts it in his life of miller this small-town newspaper man had forgotten more about the business than most metropolitan executives ever knew theatre time arrived and mr miller told his family to go on that he would join them later but he never did join them; they came home after the play to find him still deep in discussion with mr ochs; and when the two men parted after midnight mr miller was convinced that the times had found the man meeting mr flint and mr trask the next day mr ochs impressed them so favorably that he was invited to join their syndicate he was compelled to decline for their plan would have required him to invest more money than he had or would have cared to try to borrow mr flint then proposed that if the plan were carried out mr ochs should become the manager of the paper he mentioned a salary of $50000 a year--a staggering amount for a man from chattanooga but mr ochs had decided that he could not rescue the times unless he owned and controlled it the flint-trask project thereupon collapsed and another group at stockholders came forward with a proposal to consolidate the times with the recorder another daily newspaper then also in difficulties and which went out of existence the same year but mr miller and his associate editor edward cary felt sure that mr ochs could save the paper as an independent publication if he only had a little time they therefore obtained the appointment of a receiver who kept the times going while mr ochs worked out his own plan obtained the approval of stockholders and creditors and raised the needed funds takes over the times now at last his service as greeter and entertainer of distinguished visitors to chattanooga bore fruit an unknown young man from a small city however sound his plans and heartening his enthusiasm might have had some trouble persuading wary creditors that he could do what all the newspaper executives in new york had pronounced impossible but headed by a letter from president cleveland the chattanooga publisher was able to produce a mass of recommendations from men whose names meant something in new york president cleveland letter in his own handwriting said of mr ochs: with such references behind him and with the soundness of his own ideas to prove that the testimonials were not perfunctory mr ochs managed to gain acceptance of his own plan for the reorganization of the times which was transferred to him on aug 18 1896 the new plan was briefly this: the new york times company was organized with 10000 shares of capital stock and a bond issue of $500000 two thousand shares of stock were exchanged for the shares of the old company on a one-for-five basis; holders of the old company notes received in exchange bonds of the new company dollar for dollar and $200000 worth of bonds were sold at par to provide working capital the new publisher discovered when he took charge that the paper had about $100000 worth of unfunded obligations so half of that working capital was eaten up before mr ochs got started as a needed incentive each purchaser of a thousand-dollar bond got fifteen shares of stock with it; and mr ochs himself with all the money he had and all he could borrow--most of it was borrowed--bought $75000 worth of bonds carrying with them 1125 shares of stock of the rest of the stock 3876 shares just enough to make an absolute majority were put into escrow to be delivered to the publisher whenever the paper had paid its way for three consecutive years his control however was to be absolute from the first this of course was a gigantic gamble: but it was a gamble in which nobody but the purchasers of bonds for cash stood to lose anything which was not hopelessly lost already; and of these bonds the new publisher had bought nearly half the rest were purchased mainly by capitalists who considered them a good if speculative investment but would not have been seriously discommoded if the venture had failed almost the only man who stood to lose much in other words was adolph s ochs he had mortgaged his achievements of the past and his prospects of the future; but if he won everybody else would win with him competes with yellow press at the moment it seemed almost incredible that he could win; he had bought the times with $75000 and his abilities but all he had bought was a great name of late somewhat shopworn and a deficit dominating new york journalism of the period were the herald the world and the morning journal now the american; the former with an excellent and costly foreign service which the times could not hope to rival for years the latter two wildly sensational according to the ideas of that day with immense circulations built up at a price of 1 cent while the other morning papers the times included sold for 3 cents it is evident in retrospect as it was clear to mr ochs at the time that to have imitated any of these successful competitors would have been suicidal; but he would not have done it anyway there was only one sort of paper that he knew how to or cared to publish the sort of paper the chattanooga times had been ever since he took it over and the sort of paper the new york times had been in the best days of raymond and jones his salutatory announcement on aug 19 1896 published in full elsewhere in this issue promised \"to conduct a high-standard newspaper clean dignified and trustworthy\" for \"thoughtful pure-minded people\" impartial news was promised and the opening of a forum for opinion; and the continuation of the editorial policies which the paper had previously advocated with mr miller still in the editor chair despite the prosperity of the \"yellows\" mr ochs believed that there was still a public for the sort of paper the times had been in its best days and he meant to seek that public out his influence was instantly apparent in the news columns of the times which in the late unhappy days had made room for items that were free publicity rather than news and had injected some editorial bias into news reporting which the new publisher promptly stopped columns of dull matter left in from mere tradition were dropped from the paper and the policy of printing news for \"thoughtful pure-minded people\" was emphasized as against the sensationalism of the world and the journal by the adoption on oct 25 1896 of the motto \"all the news that fit to print\" which the times carries to this day this definition of the times purpose was mr ochs own; it has been much criticized but the criticisms deal usually with the phraseology rather than with its practical interpretation and the phraseology was simply an emphatic announcement that the times was not and would not be what the nineties called a yellow newspaper in place of the comic supplements of the yellows the times soon offered a pictorial sunday magazine and a few months after mr ochs took charge the saturday review of books later shifted to the sunday issue became a permanent feature of the paper letters to the editor controverting the paper editorial policy were admitted to the rejuvenated times on a scale not previously known the times of 1896 smaller and simpler as was necessitated by its constricted resources and by the less advanced newspaper technology of the period was essentially the times of today road to success a hard one the new paper found favor; in the first year of mr ochs proprietorship the circulation more than doubled and the deficit which had been $1000 a day when he took charge averaged less than a fifth of that at the end of the year but there was still a deficit; and after the years of prosperity in chattanooga the publisher had been suddenly flung back to the conditions of his beginnings as a newspaper proprietor when each week payroll was a problem all the other prominent papers in new york had millions behind them; mr ochs had nothing and his personal credit had been strained to what seemed at the time the uttermost in obtaining the money to buy the paper it turned out to be capable of extensions because there were men in new york who began to realize what he was doing with the times and to see that the paper was a good commercial risk but it was years before that problem was definitely a thing of the past; and it was years before some of the men whose investments in the times old and new mr ochs was saving for them began to realize how fully he deserved their trust some of them knew it from the first; the faith inspired in mr miller at that first interview endured and personal friendship came to reinforce it another man whose confidence in and affection for the new publisher proved of immense value was colonel marcellus hartley a member of the reorganization committee who did perhaps more than any one else to teach the young man from tennessee his way around new york and the technique of dealing with new yorkers if mr ochs way was pretty hard in the first years it was made hard partly by his own principles the volume of advertising in the times did not increase as fast as the increase in circulation warranted because the new publisher had brought to new york not only some novel ideas about the treatment of news but an unusually rigorous conscience about advertising certain types of objectionable advertising that were commonly carried in the papers of the nineties were excluded from the times from the first and a censorship system was established to investigate all offered advertising in which there was suspicion of fraud and to exclude questionable matter in mr ochs opinion all good and honest advertising was in its way news and he regarded his paper--editorial columns news columns advertising columns--as all of one piece big tammany offer rejected furthermore he was alert from the first to reject advertising which seemed to have strings to it a notable instance occurred in his first year in new york when the city government then as usual under tammany control offered all its regular advertising to the times this amounted to $150000 a year--a sum sufficient to insure success to mr ochs venture at a time when it seemed highly probable that otherwise it would end in disaster furthermore the times was assured that the offer was not expected by the tammany leaders to change the times customary attitude toward that organization; it was made simply because they felt that it was a good idea to support a conservative democratic paper in new york in the general interest of the party nevertheless the offer was refused it was mr ochs opinion that regardless of the effect such a contribution to a paper of small circulation and dubious stability might have on the staff it would be taken by the general public as proof that the times had been bought by tammany and that the paper could not afford for a moment to let that belief however unfounded be spread abroad moreover he wished to avoid that subtle and almost unrealized influence which tammany might wield by the mere threat of withdrawing its advertising once the paper had adjusted itself to that much-needed revenue a similar feeling led him four years later to reject the proposal of the republican national committee to buy a million copies at a time when the paper circulation was little more than 80000 of an issue containing an especially cogent editorial supporting the republicans on the national issues of 1900 the early years were frequently enlivened by controversies with advertisers who thought they were buying more than advertising space to one such gentleman who wanted certain guarantees from the management of the times about its advertising policies mr ochs wrote: \"you must excuse me from discussing with you the policy of the new york times that is a subject we do not care to discuss with an advertiser * * * we are seeking to secure the good-will and confidence of intelligent discriminating newspaper readers the advertiser is a secondary consideration * * * if your advertisement remains out of the new york times until you have some assurance other than the paper as it appears every day as to the policy of the publisher the times so long as it is under its present management will endeavor to get along without your business\" in the course of time the advertiser in question discovered as did others who raised similar issues that the times could get along without him better than he could get along without the times and he returned with the understanding that what he bought was space in the paper and no more these advertising policies like the policy in treating news which mr ochs announced in 1896 and followed ever afterward are now the commonplace practice of all respectable newspapers but in the nineties they were not commonplace and newspapers then and now counted respectable did not always adhere to them--until mr ochs had demonstrated that it was possible to publish a paper of those principles and make it pay two alarming setbacks despite what many practical newspaper men of the nineties must have regarded as the handicaps of honesty and dignity the times was steadily though slowly going ahead in circulation and advertising but in mr ochs first two years came two external calamities each of which in turn all but ruined the new venture before it was fairly started in 1897 the old united press which most of the new york papers had been supporting at heavy cost collapsed mr ochs whose chattanooga times was a member of the western associated press immediately applied for membership in that organization for the new york times as did the other new york papers the world had previously been the only member of the associated press in new york and joseph pulitzer had the power of veto over new applicants in the city he readily agreed to admit the sun the herald and the tribune; but at first he would not have the associated press service extended to the times the paper was dying he said and there was no use in prolonging the agony refusal of associated press service at a period when the times could afford very little special correspondence would have ruined the paper; but eventually mr pulitzer was persuaded to let it come into the associated press with a class b non-voting membership which though it carried a derogatory implication with it did give the times the associated press news a few years later the associated press had to be reorganized under a new york charter; and mr ochs whose paper could no longer be stigmatized as \"moribund\" became a full member a director and member of the executive committee he held these offices for the rest of his life and was one of the three or four men who practically made the associated press of today the second and more disastrous external event was the war with spain it was largely made by the newspapers and was perhaps the greatest opportunity for newspaper showmanship that has ever been offered the immense expenditures for staff writers staff artists special dispatch boats and cable tolls in which the other new york papers competed were beyond the capacity of the times; it had to be content with the associated press news supplemented by a little mail correspondence and consequently could not hope to share in the fantastic rise in circulation which partially compensated some of its more prosperous rivals for the money they poured out but inevitably the times lost advertising when the other papers did; and a loss that the hearst pulitzer reid and bennett fortunes could bear threatened to be fatal to the publisher of the times who had used up his meager working capital and had absolutely nothing else the deficit in mr ochs second year was $78000--larger than in the first year; the circulation had been pushed up to 25000 but the advertising linage of 1898 showed only a 10 percent gain over 1896 something had to be done mr ochs was advised to raise the price of the paper from 3 cents to 5 cents a copy on the theory that people who wanted his kind of paper would as soon pay 5 cents for it as 3 to the astonishment of every one mr ochs proposed instead to cut the price to 1 cent faith in public vindicated this was to prove one of the most brilliant of his inspirations; but it had behind it the solid faith of a lifetime--the faith that there was a public for the only kind of paper mr ochs could or would publish and a larger public than the times then enjoyed mr ochs believed that there were many people in the city who bought the \"yellow journals\" only because they cost a third as much as the other papers and that they would buy a different sort of paper if they could get it for the same price he was well aware that the 1-cent price was regarded as the badge of the yellow press and that some people would suppose when the times went to that price that it was going to that manner too; he knew that there would be--as indeed at first there were--suspicions that some outside interest had subsidized the paper his only defense against these suspicions would have to be the paper as it appeared every day; and he had faith that people who could now get for 1 cent the same kind of paper that they had formerly paid 3 cents for would realize that the suspicions were baseless they did despite the universal belief among new york newspaper men outside the times that the cut in price was the beginning of the end it was in fact the beginning of victory the circulation of the paper instantly began to leap; the public for that kind of paper at a lower price which mr ochs alone had discerned was actually there a year after the change the circulation of the times had trebled rising from 25000 to 76000 and except for a brief recession after the world war it has been rising ever since even though in 1918 when all newspapers had to face increased production costs the price per copy was raided to 2 cents mr ochs third year as publisher showed a profit of $50000 and from then on the success of the times was assured so obvious was this that the reorganization committee of 1896 which was to continue until the paper was firmly on its feet was dissolved at the end of the second year the original agreement had stipulated that the 3876 shares held in escrow should be turned over to mr ochs when he had made the paper pay for three successive years on july 1 1900 he had fulfilled this condition and became the owner of a majority stock interest in the times which he retained ever afterward with some increase growth financed with profits the great fight of mr ochs life was won therefore by 1900 and he won it by himself other men before and afterward made great contributions to the paper the value of which he was always the first to acknowledge but he was the man who as e a bradford a veteran of the editorial staff put it \"found the paper on the rocks and turned them into foundation stones\" another editorial veteran f j mortimer amplified this a little: \"the rest of the paper plant and men was just the same the day before he took command and the day afterward he was the only difference; and from the moment he came in a paper that had been steadily going down turned right around and started going up\" that it kept on going up was due very largely mr ochs opinion to the fact that most of the profits were plowed back into the business--plowed back needless to say in a wise and productive fashion the times paid its way out of its own earnings on mr ochs twenty-fifth anniversary aug 18 1921 he announced that the gross income of the paper for that quarter century had been about $100000000 of which only $3750000--an average of $125000 a year--had been withdrawn as dividends the rest of the profits had gone into financing the growth of the paper the story of adolph s ochs during those years was the story of the new york times the two are inseparably woven he had already laid down his fundamental code of integrity soundness and completeness and from this he never varied but new inventions new ideas and the broadening horizon of world events made necessary a constantly widening interpretation of \"all the news that fit to print\" as the times grew mr ochs grew with it seizing upon every improvement in technique that would enable his paper to get the news more quickly and more fully and to print it and get it to the reader in the best possible form and with the least possible lapse of time the development of the times carried the double threads of constantly improved newspaper making and of world-shaking events which put an unprecedented strain upon every facility a newspaper had an account of the mechanical improvements in the production of the times since mr ochs took over the paper would be a long story in itself in 1896 the times was still being published on park row in a building which at its completion eight years earlier had been regarded as the last word in newspaper housing with the paper growing prosperity this building became too small realizing the northward drift of business and population mr ochs resolved to build in what is now known as times square then a decidedly second-rate neighborhood the design chosen for this structure which is still one of new york landmarks was derived from the celebrated giotto campanile at florence and it was regarded as one of the architectural triumphs of its decade pressrooms and editorial rooms were newly equipped and enlarged and in january 1905 the paper was moved uptown without missing an edition new quarters soon outgrown perhaps nothing so dramatically indicates the growth of the times during this period as does the fact that this spacious building planned with all the foresight that proprietor architect and staff possessed became too small in exactly seven years the times grew out of its quarters then and afterward somewhat as a healthy boy grows out of his clothes from the times building which still bears that name the paper migrated in 1913 to the times annex at 229 west forty-third street just off the square in 1924 and again in 1931 additions had to be made to the annex in each case mr ochs took pride in erecting a dignified appropriate and beautiful building meanwhile the development of rotogravure made necessary a separate plant for that process constructed at 636 west forty-fourth street in 1925 a new building was erected in brooklyn in 1931 to print the paper brooklyn and queens edition the processes of setting type of stereotyping and of printing were continually being improved and the times under mr ochs direction never lagged in taking advantage of each new improvement mr ochs who had set type by hand and had done some of his first printing on a hand-operated press took a personal interest in each forward step in the mechanical department in becoming a newspaper proprietor he took pride in not ceasing to be a printer--and a good one in 1926 he found it necessary to become by proxy a papermaker as well as a printer in that year the times became a large stockholder in the spruce falls power and paper company with holdings of approximately 5000 square miles of timber rights in northern ontario and subsequently one of the greatest papermaking plants in the world was erected by the company at kapuskasing ont from this mighty plant comes now all of the newsprint used by the times the mechanics of communication were always important in mr ochs eyes he was early interested in marconi experiments with the wireless and arranged with marconi in cooperation with the london times for the first regular transatlantic wireless news service in 1907 for a time most of the times european news was transmitted in this fashion mr ochs was also a pioneer enthusiast for aviation encouraged some of the first cross-country flights and made use of airplanes for carrying photographs and delivering papers he saw too that improved means of communication and higher speed presses would be of little value without a well-organized world-wide news service and this he set out to get just as he had earlier done on a smaller scale in chattanooga in 1901 he arranged with the london times for an exchange of services which gave him the dispatches of that paper from all parts of the earth it was this cooperation that gave the times the first wireless account of a naval battle--that sent by captain lionel james from a dispatch boat 150 miles at sea during the encounter between the russian and japanese fleets in 1904 mr ochs had a keen interest in exploration both for its own sake and for its value as news and showed it in practically every expedition of importance from peary journey to the north pole to admiral byrd flight over the south pole and afterward he realized too the value of scientific news of all kinds and the times gave much space to it especially after the world war but complete presentation of all news worth printing whether routine or otherwise continued to be his ideal the world war was a severe test not only of a paper ability to get and print the news but of its editorial soundness and of the impartiality of its news columns editorially the times decided that the german government was in the wrong in the news columns and in the sunday editions it aimed to present not only all the actual events of the war without bias but also to give every point of view a chance for expression mr ochs took it as a tribute to the success of this latter policy that the times was accused by german sympathizers of favoring the allies and by allied sympathizers of favoring germany the times organized its european news service so thoroughly that it sometimes published more special foreign dispatches than all other american newspapers combined of particular value to students of the war was its practice of printing all important documents in full no matter what their length at the end of the war mr ochs had the satisfaction of knowing that his newspaper had reached a peak of prestige and prosperity which in the earlier years he had hardly dared dream of in june 1918 the times had received the first award of the pulitzer gold medal for \"disinterested and meritorious service\" for publishing in full so many official reports documents and speeches by european statesmen relating to the progress and conduct of the war advertising circulation and the size of the paper had expanded greatly though the records of 1918 were to be far surpassed in later years mr ochs was not the man to take this success as a purely personal triumph and he was generous in his appreciation of the men who had worked with him to bring it about his material success probably meant less to him than the demonstration that his ideals of journalism and his faith in the fundamental decency of human nature were sound in fight for world peace the post-war period did nothing to shake either his ideals or his faith though it culminated in the depression of 1929 editorially the times threw itself into the fight to bring about world peace through the league of nations just as it had fought for the same end in a different way during the war the post-war news was just as important and almost as exciting as that of the war itself and the times expanded its news-gathering network in europe and all over the world it continued to print important documents in full beginning with the full text of the versailles treaty which it was the first paper in the world to publish completely it retained its interest in science and exploration it adhered to its old policy of presenting the news without bias its success in this field was illustrated in 1932 when walter duranty the times correspondent in moscow received the pulitzer prize editorially the times had as little sympathy as a newspaper could have with the ideas and policies of the soviet government yet it was able through mr duranty to give the news of the communist experiment so impartially that it gained the confidence of readers of all shades of opinion in may 1930 the times received the first award of the medal of the university of missouri school of journalism \"for distinguished service in journalism\" the success of the times might have suggested to another man than mr ochs the possibility of a chain of newspapers based on the same idea which as it always seemed to him would work not only in chattanooga and new york but in any other american city in 1899 mr ochs did contemplate buying the new york telegram then owned by james gordon bennett later in 1901 and 1902 he bought the philadelphia times and ledger and amalgamated them his brother the late george w ochs oakes who took the added name of oakes in 1917 becoming editor in 1913 mr ochs sold the ledger to cyrus h k curtis in 1918 he had almost completed arrangements to buy the herald and the telegram when the death of mr bennett put an end to the negotiations in the end mr ochs came to regard the management of the new york times with its growing circulation not only in new york but throughout the world as a big enough job for any man as related but independent enterprises however he established the annalist a weekly financial review; current history a monthly survey of world affairs long edited by george w ochs oakes and the midweek pictorial an illustrated review of the week news as component parts of the times he developed the weekly book review the times magazine and the sunday feature section steady rise in circulation the steady growth of the paper is reflected in the circulation statistics over a period of years the figures by two-year periods from 1896 to 1934 are as follows: *averages as reported to postoffice department mr ochs often spoke of this circulation growth as \"a vindication of the newspaper reader\" in that it proved that there was a public interested in a clean dignified newspaper there was nothing perfunctory in his relation to anything that the times did he was interested in every activity as an exemplification of the ideals that he as a publisher was trying to carry out he took a similar interest in the business policies of the paper a field in which he was just as much at home as in the news and editorial departments in his eyes the times was a unified enterprise with operating distinctions between the different departments but with no difference as to fundamental principles among them truth in advertising was as important to him as truth in the news columns and integrity in the editorial columns as he proved again and again at whatever sacrifice of revenue the times censorship of advertising set a standard for american journalism in the field of circulation mr ochs never had any sympathy with artificial devices to bring in new readers he relied on the paper itself to be its own circulation-getter and the circulation department did its work without any offer of premiums or other special inducements mr ochs made much of his conception of the new york times as the accepted newspaper of record it was the obligation of a newspaper he thought to present a complete record of its time an important and logical part of this conception was the inauguration in 1913 of the new york times index listing and cross-referencing every news item in the times columns in 1927 to make the record in its files imperishable the times began printing each day a limited edition upon pure rag paper stock for indefinite preservation in bound files the personality of mr ochs dominated his newspaper probably few other journals have ever reflected the personality of their publishers more definitely and completely than the times has mr ochs--but in a different way from that generally associated with such a reflection he placed an imprint of character upon the organization he did not permit the times to exploit himself his personal interests antipathies or likes or to swerve in the slightest degree because of his own opinions from the balance of impartial news presentation his name rarely appeared in its columns mr ochs believed that a single authority should control and direct a newspaper he thought that committee management was fatal ineffective but though he was supreme he welcomed the frank expression of opinions contrary to his own he once said that one of the most valuable men on his staff was one who rarely agreed with him mr ochs always could count upon this man for a strong reasoned statement of the other point of view pioneer in many ways mr ochs eager active mind devoting itself constantly to the times was generally so far in advance of others that some of his associates felt their task was to serve as a brake upon his audacity generally he was looked upon as a conservative yet it was he who pioneered in many fields of newspaper building he was the first to bring rotogravure printing for newspaper picture sections to the united states he looked upon this beautiful process of printing as the best means of presenting news in pictures to readers the times rotogravure section has not shown oddities and notorious persons but has accepted its task as gathering the important news of the world in pictures the times own wide world photo service with bureaus and correspondents all over the world for the purpose of assembling the best news pictures was mr ochs idea of what such a department of a newspaper should be again mr ochs was a pioneer in the improvement of newspaper printing he developed the idea of the times typographical standards which forbade display advertisements to use unlimited areas of crude blacks in type or illustration of bizarre arrangements of type--a forward step now adopted by more than a score of other important newspapers mr ochs had a habit of making friendly and unostentatious tours of the building often with some distinguished visitor his use of power had nothing of arbitrariness; rather was it exerted as an influence the editorial page for instance commanded his keenest interest and when at the office he was accustomed to interrupt his executive duties at noon each day to preside over the editorial conference which argued out and decided on the editorials for the following issue in consonance with his general theory of newspaper policy he believed that an editorial page should be temperate in statement and should recognize that there is usually something to be said on both sides of a question coming up from chattanooga he had described himself as a conservative democrat a term which had some meaning in grover cleveland day mr ochs had a whole-hearted admiration for woodrow wilson as he had had for cleveland but his democratic principles did not prevent him giving support to the president of whatever political faith so long as the administration policies warranted it consistently broad-minded in this and other matters of policy the editorial page was a reflection of mr ochs personality naturally he did not bring to the times editorial writers who were not in sympathy with its general principles; he did not believe that it would be fair to the writers or to the times to do so yet the times editorial staff under mr ochs direction had room not only for the full freedom of the individual writer conscience but for a considerable variety of temperament and opinion on points not involving his fundamental principles mr ochs was always ready to listen to argument; in fact he enjoyed the clash of opinions on certain issues which he felt keenly he did not yield but even then no man ever had to write against his own convictions the power of adolph s ochs was not that of the money which had come to him but of his personality and his ideas to the times he was more than a proprietor; he was what he had been to foreman collins of the knoxville chronicle--\"a necessity hard to part with\" the least pretentious of men he refused to make a mystery of his own success the principles he had followed seemed to him self-evident and he believed that they would have the same results if they were followed anywhere else to a newspaper man who observed in later years that mr ochs had come to new york and taught new york journalists something new he remarked that he had only reminded them of something they had forgotten speaking at the convention of the national editorial association in 1916 he said that he had practiced no new journalism in new york--only the old journalism the kind that succeeded best in small towns the policy of having no policy except to be as right as you know how--this had been his sole admonition to a new editor of his chattanooga paper--was what he had followed in chattanooga and in new york as well it means that clear honest thinking not expediency or partisanship dictated the editorial decisions he seemed hardly aware that high principles though they make success a public good instead of a public evil do not guarantee success; and that his own achievement was due not only to the ideas and ideals which he cherished but to his boundless energy his supreme confidence his willingness to stake everything on what he believed to be right and sound and the confidence he inspired in other men he had the qualities of a born leader he had the rare ability as he showed in 1896 to win victories with a defeated and discouraged army paper leader to the end mr ochs continued to direct the times all his life keeping in close touch by telephone or cable whenever he was away from the office as one of his subordinates testified before a senate committee which once had some suspicions of absentee influence on the times he was when in town \"there every day\" his town house was for many years at 308 west seventy-fifth street until in the fall of 1931 he bought an estate in white plains during the war mr ochs purchased the country seat of george foster peabody abenia on lake george and there used to spend his summers in a colony where he had many friendships and where he could enjoy a daily game of not very laborious or too serious golf; but even during the summer absences at the lake he was in communication with the times by telephone morning afternoon and evening in his later years he traveled in europe more frequently than he had done before the war became acquainted with virtually all the leaders of politics and public opinion and devoted himself with all his private energies as well as those of his paper to the endeavor to smooth out misunderstandings and promote a better relation between europe and the united states the publishing of the times was his avocation and his hobby as well as his vocation he put into it the best that he had to give to his fellow-men with a high seriousness and an unremitting sense of responsibility he was a religious man in his daily work as well as outside of it and many of his statements bore testimony thereto not only by tradition but by conviction he was a firm adherent of the reformed jewish faith he said at the cleveland convention of the union of american hebrew congregations in january 1927: \"what we as a religious people have preserved through centuries of oppression is rapidly becoming the accepted concept of the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man it is called modernism but it harks back to the underlying faith of an ancient people who gave to civilization the ten commandments the prophets and the psalms\" it was in keeping with his conception of his faith and of his people place in history that he was opposed to zionism in a statement in the american israelite in 1922 he said that \"the greatest heritage of the jew is his religion * * * as a distinctive race the jews need no place in modern civilization\" nevertheless he was open-minded enough to be immensely impressed during his travels in palestine by the achievements and the spirit of the zionist pioneers however much he questioned the ultimate validity of their objective active in well-doing for many years he was a trustee of temple emanu-el in new york and in 1924 he gave to the congregation in chattanooga a new building which was named in honor of his parents the julius and bertha ochs memorial temple in 1926 he undertook the chairmanship of the committee which succeeded in raising more than $4000000 for the hebrew union college which his father- in-law had founded one of the principal interests of his later years was the park movement in which he had been active long before as one of the advocates of the proposal for the chickamauga national park near chattanooga it was due chiefly to him that the lookout mountain national park was later instituted to preserve this historic battlefield nearer the city; he was active also in the organization which preserved the battlefield of saratoga the times consistent endeavors to protect new york city parks against encroachment is of course well known in recognition of this stand the park association of new york city awarded its medal to mr ochs in 1931 of his contributions to public causes perhaps the most notable was the gift of $500000 which he caused the new york times to make to finance the preparation of the manuscript of the dictionary of american biography whose successive volumes have met a need of american scholarship which had long been felt the new york times also began in 1928 the preparation and publication of the american year book of the numerous foreign decorations which he might have had mr ochs accepted only one-- membership in the french legion of honor in which he was later promoted to be commander he made an exception of the legion because it was so universally looked upon as being free from political significance to the acceptance of academic honors fittingly bestowed on a publisher who had done his best to make his paper an educational institution he was more hospitable he was made an honorary master of arts by yale in 1922 and in subsequent years received honorary doctorates from columbia university the university of chattanooga new york university dartmouth and lincoln university in 1927 he received the gold medal of the national institute of social sciences in 1929 he was one of seven citizens of new york cited for distinguished service by the chamber of commerce and in 1931 he became a member of the american philosophical society no honor gratified him more however than the title of citizen emeritus of chattanooga which was formally conferred on him in july 1928 at the conclusion of a three-day celebration of his semi-centennial as proprietor of the chattanooga times this celebration was organized by the city and county governments and attended by deputations from the associated press the american newspaper publishers\\' association the newspaper publishers and the advertising club of new york city and the chamber of commerce of the state of new york he always retained an affection for chattanooga and an interest in its affairs and the friendships which he had made there as a struggling young man were broken only by death welfare of the staff of the welfare of the army of employes required to get out the times mr ochs was always solicitous on march 12 1918 he celebrated his sixtieth birthday by the establishment of group insurance for all employes increasing the maximum amount on later anniversaries his quarter- centennial as publisher of the times was marked by the institution of a system of sick benefits and a retirement pension fund for mr ochs unusual thoughtfulness and generosity in individual instances hundreds of the times staff in both important and humble positions had cause to be grateful an incident illustrates his unvarying thoughtfulness junior employes of the times receiving less than $18 weekly have a lunch card which permits them to purchase a complete 50- cent lunch for 10 cents when the times annex was enlarged in 1931 it was necessary to close the restaurant for two weeks and due notice was given upon the reopening of the restaurant every employe having a lunch card was surprised to receive at mr ochs orders a check to cover the extra cost of their lunches for the period of closing the hundred neediest cases a charity which came close to mr ochs heart and engaged his warm personal interest was the collection of funds each year at the christmas season for \"the hundred neediest cases\" this feature was inaugurated by him in 1912 when a fund of $3630 was collected to be distributed to persons in direst need chosen from lists furnished by the leading charitable organizations of the city the appeal was and still is made solely through the publication of brief individual narratives in the times in this way mr ochs tried to bring home to his readers the poignant facts of destitution and to enlist their cooperation in relieving it there was no personal solicitation; the contributions were wholly spontaneous sometimes coming from readers who did not even give their names; and every cent collected went to relieve want the expense of administration being met by the charitable organizations sending in the lists of cases and the other expenses by the times no feature of the paper had more importance in mr ochs eyes during the christmas season than this he followed the campaign closely even in its details and rejoiced as the totals mounted the number of cases relieved during the first twenty years totaled more than 5000 and the number of individuals nearly 18000 for the christmas season of 1930 the total of gifts was $345790 in many instances contributions came from persons who were themselves out of work and limited as to funds trust funds gifts given in memory of the dead and repeated contributions from readers who took pride in keeping up the annual totals made \"the hundred neediest cases\" a notable institution and its success was a source of real joy to mr ochs monuments he leaves mr ochs leaves behind him two newspapers--he retained his controlling interest in the chattanooga times--the building of which occupied nearly all his energies for nearly all the working years of his life both were close to his heart he could not have existed without intimate daily contact with their affairs each was created out of next to nothing by his personal efforts in the face of discouragements which would have defeated most men and of obstacles which seemed insuperable these newspapers are his monuments and he would now be willing to be judged by them but his greatest monument is invisible--the principle of clean temperate and impartial presentation of news and of higher standards in advertising these are now such commonplaces of decent newspaper practice that many newspaper men of today may think they have obtained from time immemorial but they did not secure a foothold easily or automatically; they did not prevail in new york city until adolph s ochs came to town from chattanooga and risked everything he had on his faith that not only could such a newspaper be published but that there was a public which wanted it mr ochs was more than a publisher he was a man who had faith in humanity and who backed that faith by all the intelligence all the energy and all the fighting spirit that was in him his views on life meaning in october 1931 will durant in preparing his book \"on the meaning of life\" asked mr ochs for his views the following paragraphs are quoted from that book: evidently religion does not die; in the vast majority of men it is still a living force for good and ill i find a sincere note of it in the reply of adolph ochs publisher of that finest achievement in modern journalism the new york times; by this letter i am better able to understand the solid quiet success of this man in making his paper the most respected and most influential in america without ever catering to the mob \"new york oct 22 1931 \"dear mr durant: \"* * * you ask me what meaning life has for me what help--if any--religion gives me what keeps me going what are the sources of my inspiration and my energy what is the goal or motive-force of my toil where i find my consolation and my happiness where in the last resort my treasure lies \"to make myself clearly understood if i were able to do so would take more time and thought than i can give the matter now suffice it for me to say that i inherited good health and sound moral principles; i found pleasure in work that came to my hand and in doing it conscientiously; i found joy and satisfaction in being helpful to my parents and others and in thus making my life worth while found happiness and consolation my jewish home life and religion gave me a spiritual uplift and a sense of responsibility to my subconscious better self--which i think is the god within me the unknowable the inexplicable this makes me believe i am more than an animal and that this life cannot be the end of our spiritual nature \"yours faithfully \"adolph s ochs\" more and more it stands out that a man must combine action with thought in order to lead a life that shall have unity and significance surely a monument like the times is meaning enough for one life adolph s ochs proud chattanooga flag has he unfurled high \\'mid the city-banners of the world; a bit of blue above the crimson dawn a single star--when all the rest have gone-- staying to welcome through the eastern gate the best that is to be for his loved state; a flag upon faith lookout mount to scan the wider destiny of western man-- that signals to the youth below the way from out the dark despairs of yesterday up past the smoky altars toward the west in never-halting never-aging quest',\n",
       " 'flagstaff ariz nov 13--dr percival lowell founder and director of the lowell observatory here and an astronomer of international reputation died here last night from a stroke of apoplexy suffered yesterday morning dr lowell apparently was in good health when he arrived here recently from a lecture trip professor percival lowell astronomer and author of books on the far east whose popular fame rests on the association of his name with the theory that mars is inhabited was born in boston on march 13 1855 the great controversy among astronomers in which he played a leading part began in 1907 after his announcement that the observations made by his astronomical station the lowell observatory at flagstaff ariz proved that mars was inhabited professor lowell had put the theory forward tentatively as early as 1895 many eminent astronomers in this country and europe accepted his conclusions of 1907 as unassailable others were skeptical professor lowell continued from year to year to produce fresh evidence in favor of his theory by his observations at flagstaff where is located the best astronomical plant in the world for the observation of mars professor lowell theory begins with the demonstration that the primary requisites for human life exist on the planet--water heat and atmosphere his positive proof of the existence of human life on mars is the network of lines which mark certain areas of the planet face indicating the digging of artificial canals which would require an intelligence and engineering skill as great or greater than that possessed by the inhabitants of this earth the seasons on mars the great white surfaces seen on the poles of mars professor lowell held are polar snowcaps and the fact that they shrink in size and then increase again at certain seasons indicates the snowfall of the martian winter and the thaw of the summer lowell describes a series of observations in which it was discovered that with the coming of a martian spring and the melting of the polar snow certain of the dark areas grew darker even showing straight black lines crisscrossed over their surface and over the surface of the orange-ochre areas; and that with the coming of the martian autumn those dark areas and lines faded almost to the vanishing point professor lowell continued in his book: \"but if instead of being due to water the blue-green tint had been due to leaves and grasses just such a fading-out as was observed should have taken place as autumn came on and that without disproportionate increase of green elsewhere for the great continental areas being desert are incapable of supporting vegetation; from which it follows that mars is badly off for water and that the planet is dependent on the melting of the polar snows for practically its whole supply * * * \"now if a planet were at any stage of its career able to support life it is probably that a diminishing water supply would be the beginning of the end of that life for the air would outlast the available water those of its inhabitants who have succeeded in surviving would find themselves at last face to face with the relentlessness of a scarcity of water constantly growing greater till at last they would all die of thirst either directly or indirectly; for either they themselves would not have water enough to drink or the plants or animals which constituted their diet would perish for lack of it--an alternative of small choice to them unless they were conventionally particular as to their mode of death water the supreme problem \"before this lamentable conclusion was reached however there would come a time in the course of the planet history when water was not yet wanting but was simply scarce and requiring to be husbanded; when for the inhabitants the one supreme problem of existence would be the water problem--how to get water enough to sustain life and how best to utilize every drop of water they could get\" professor lowell goes on to show that only irrigation on a vast scale could save the inhabitants he puts aside by elaborate reasoning the various theories which have been put forward to account for the canals of mars as natural phenomena and concludes that they are the work of human skill the co-operation displayed by a whole planet in these works are the basis for some conclusions on what must be the political and social life on the planet professor lowell was the first to discover water vapor on mars his careful observations detected 550 canals on the planet schiaparelli having found only 104 in 1910 professor lowell discovered a new canal 1000 miles in length in the spring of 1910 he lectured on his discoveries before the royal institute of london and the association astronomique of paris where his theories created wide interest but left many unconvinced his other discoveries his investigations were not confined solely to mars professor lowell made discoveries concerning mercury venus and saturn and financed several expeditions to odd corners of the earth for research and observation of all sorts of polar phenomena in 1894 he made a visit to tripoli to observe the eclipse of that year from a favored spot in 1906 he sent an expedition to the andes to photograph mars he received the jansen medal of the french astronomical society in 1904 for his researches on mars and a gold medal in 1908 from the sociedad astronomica de mexico he was appointed non-resident professor of astronomy at the massachusetts institute of technology in 1902 and was a member of the royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland the french astronomical society the american philosophical society the national and american geographical societies and a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences dr lowell began life after his graduation from harvard in 1876 by several years of travel and scientific observation in all parts of the world but particularly in china korea and japan in 1883 while in japan he was appointed secretary and counselor to the korea special mission to the united states returning to korea the same year by invitation from the king he spent the winter at seoul where he became popular with the people outside of his astronomical publications his writings were mostly concerned with phases of oriental life and thought professor lowell writings he was the author of the following works: \"cho-son the land of the morning calm;\" \"the soul of the far east\" \"noto\" \"occult japan\" \"mars\" \"annals of the lowell observatory\" \"mars and its canals\" \"mars as the abode of life\" and \"the evolution of worlds\" dr lowell was the son of augustus and katherine bigelow lowell his father was vice president of the american academy and trustee of the lowell institute both of boston his mother was a daughter of abbott lawrence minister to england 1849 to 1852 he was a cousin of james russell lowell and a brother of a lawrence lowell president of harvard university',\n",
       " 'albert einstein was born at ulm wuerttemberg germany on march 14 1879 his boyhood was spent in munich where his father who owned electro-technical works had settled the family migrated to italy in 1894 and albert was sent to a cantonal school at aarau in switzerland he attended lectures while supporting himself by teaching mathematics and physics at the polytechnic school at zurich until 1900 finally after a year as tutor at schaffthausen he was appointed examiner of patents at the patent office at bern where having become a swiss citizen he remained until 1909 it was in this period that he obtained his phd degree at the university of zurich and published his first papers on physical subjects these were so highly esteemed that in 1909 he was appointed extraordinary professor of theoretical physics at the university of zurich in 1911 he accepted the chair of physics at prague only to be induced to return to his own polytechnic school at zurich as full professor the next year in 1913 a special position was created for him in berlin as director of the kaiser wilhelm physical institute he was elected a member of the royal prussian academy of sciences and received a stipend sufficient to enable him to devote all his time to research without any restrictions or routine duties elected to royal society he was elected a foreign member of the royal society in 1921 having also been made previously a member of the amsterdam and copenhagen academies while the universities of geneva manchester rostock and princeton conferred honorary degrees on him in 1925 he received the copley medal of the royal society and in 1926 the gold medal of the royal astronomical society in recognition of his theory of relativity he received a nobel price in 1921 honors continued to be conferred on him he was made a member of the institute de france one of the few foreigners ever to achieve such a distinction other great universities throughout the world including oxford cambridge paris madrid buenos aires zurich yeshiva harvard london and brussels awarded honorary doctorates to him one of the highest american scientific honors the franklin institute medal came to him in 1935 when he startled the scientific world by failing to deliver more than a mere \"thank-you\" in lieu of the scientific address customary on such occasions he made up for it later by contributing an important paper to the journal of the franklin institute dealing with ideas he explained that were not quite ripe at the time he received the medal dr einstein married mileva marec a fellow-student in switzerland in 1901 they had two sons albert einstein jr an electrical engineer who also came to this country and eduard the marriage ended in divorce he married again in 1917 this time his cousin elsa einstein a widow with two daughters she died in princeton in 1936 to institute at princeton in \\'32 when the institute for advanced study was organized in 1932 dr einstein was offered and accepted the place of professor of mathematics and theoretical physics and served also as the head of the mathematics department the institute was situated at princeton nj and dr einstein made plans to live there about half of each year these plans were changed suddenly adolf hitler rose to power in germany and essential human liberty even for jews with world reputations like dr einstein became impossible in germany he announced that he would not return to berlin sailed for europe and went to belgium immediately many nations invited him to make his home in their lands in the late spring of 1933 dr einstein learned in belgium that his two step-daughters had been forced to flee germany not long after that he was notified through the press that he had been ousted from the supervising board of the german bureau of standards his home at caputh was sacked by hitler brown shirts on the allegation that the world-renowned physicist and pacifist had a vast store of arms hidden there the prussian academy of science expelled him and also attacked him for having made statements regarding hitler atrocities his reply was this: \"i do not want to remain in a state where individuals are not conceded equal rights before the law for freedom of speech and doctrine\" in september of 1933 he fled from belgium and went into seclusion on the coast of england fearful that the nazis had plans upon his life then he journeyed to princeton and made his home there he bought a home in princeton and settled down to pass his remaining years there in 1940 he became a citizen of the united states in 1904 albert einstein then an obscure young man of 25 could be seen daily in the late afternoon wheeling a baby carriage on the streets of bern switzerland halting now and then unmindful of the traffic around him to scribble down some mathematical symbols in a notebook that shared the carriage with his infant son also named albert out of those symbols came the most explosive ideas in the age-old strivings of man to fathom the mystery of his universe out of them incidentally came the atomic bomb which viewed from the long-range perspective of mankind intellectual and spiritual history may turn out einstein fervently hoped to have been just a minor by-product with those symbols dr einstein was building his theory of relativity in that baby carriage with his infant son was dr einstein universe-in-the-making a vast finite-infinite four-dimensional universe in which the conventional universe--existing in absolute three-dimensional space and in absolute three-dimensional time of past present and future--vanished into a mere subjective shadow dr einstein was then building his universe in his spare time on the completion of his day routine work as a humble $600-a-year examiner in the government patent office in bern published four papers a few months later in 1905 the entries in the notebook were published in four epoch-making scientific papers in the first he described a method for determining molecular dimensions in the second he explained the photo-electric effect the basis of electronics for which he won the nobel prize in 1921 in the third he presented a molecular kinetic theory of heat the fourth and last paper that year entitled \"electrodynamics of moving bodies\" a short article of thirty-one pages was the first presentation of what became known as the special relativity theory three of the papers were published one at a time in volume 17 of the german scientific journal annalen der physik leading journal of physics in the world at the time the fourth was printed in volume 18 neither dr einstein nor the world he lived in nor man concept of his material universe were ever the same again many other scientific papers of startling originality and intellectual boldness were published by dr einstein in the succeeding years the scientific fraternity in the world of physics particularly the leaders of the group recognized from the beginning that a new star of the first magnitude had appeared on their firmament but with the passing of time his fame spread to other circles and by 1920 the name of einstein had become synonymous with relativity a theory universally regarded as so profound that only twelve men in the entire world were believed able to fathom its depths legend grew with years paradoxically as the years passed the figure of einstein the man became more and more remote while that of einstein the legend came ever nearer to the masses of mankind they grew to know him not as a universe-maker whose theories they could not hope to understand but as a world citizen one of the outstanding spiritual leaders of his generation a symbol of the human spirit and its highest aspirations \"the world around einstein has changed very much since he published his first discoveries * * * but his attitude to the world around him has not changed\" wrote dr phillipp frank dr einstein biographer in 1947 \"he has remained an individualist who prefers to be unencumbered by social relations and at the same time a fighter for social equality and human fraternity \"many famous scholars live in the distinguished university town\" princeton dr frank continues \"but no inhabitant will simply number einstein as one among many other famous people for the people of princeton in particular and for the world at large he is not just a great scholar but rather one of the legendary figures of the twentieth century einstein acts and words are not simply noted and judged as facts; instead each has its symbolic significance * * *\" \"saintly\" \"noble\" and \"lovable\" were the words used to describe him by those who knew him even casually he radiated humor warmth and kindliness he loved jokes and laughed easily princeton residents would see him walk in their midst a familiar figure yet a stranger a close neighbor yet at the same time a visitor from another world and as he grew older his otherworldiness became more pronounced yet his human warmth did not diminish outward appearance meant nothing to him princetonians old and young soon got used to the long-haired figure in pullover sweater and unpressed slacks wandering in their midst a knitted stocking cap covering his head in winter \"my passionate interest in social justice and social responsibility\" he wrote \"has always stood in curious contrast to a marked lack of desire for direct association with men and women i am a horse for single harness not cut out for tandem or team work i have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or state to my circle of friends or even to my own family these ties have always been accompanied by a vague aloofness and the wish to withdraw into myself increases with the years \"such isolation is sometimes bitter but i do not regret being cut off from the understanding and sympathy of other men i lose something by it to be sure but i am compensated for it in being rendered independent of the customs opinions and prejudices of others and am not tempted to rest my peace of mind upon such shiftless foundations\" center of controversies it was this independence that made dr einstein on occasions the center of controversy as the result of his championship of some highly unpopular causes he declared himself a stanch pacifist in germany during world war i and brought down upon his head a storm of violent criticism from all sides when outstanding representatives of german art and science signed following the german invasion of belgium in violation of treaty the \"manifesto of ninety-two german intellectuals\" asserting that \"german culture and german militarism are identical\" dr einstein refused to sign and again faced ostracism and the wrath of the multitudes but he never wavered when his conscience dictated that he take a course of action no matter how unpopular one of these occasions came on jan 12 1953 when he wrote to president harry s truman: \"my conscience compels me to urge you to commute the death sentence of julius and ethel rosenberg\" the two convicted atomic spies who were executed five months later in june 1953 he wrote a letter to a school teacher in which he characterized certain tactics of a congressional investigating committee as \"a kind of inquisition\" that \"violates the spirit of the constitution\" and advised the \"minority of intellectuals\" to refuse to testify on the ground that \"it is shameful for a blameless citizen to submit to such an inquisition\" faced with this evil he said he could \"see only the revolutionary way of non-cooperation in the sense of gandhi\" later that year dr einstein advised a witness not to answer any questions by senator joseph r mccarthy republican of wisconsin relating to personal beliefs politics associations with other people reading thinking and writing as a violation of the first amendment which provides constitutional guarantees of free speech and associations the witness in refusing to cooperate with the subcommittee then headed by senator mccarthy said he was doing so on the advice of dr einstein who confirmed the witness statement \"he was a severe critic of modern methods of education \"it is nothing short of a miracle\" he said \"that modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry for this delicate little plant aside from stimulation stands mainly in need of freedom\" his political ideal he emphasized frequently was democracy the distinctions separating the social classes he wrote \"are false in the last analysis they rest on force i am convinced that degeneracy follows every autocratic system of violence for violence inevitably attracts moral inferiors * * * for this reason i have always been passionately opposed to such regimes as exist in russia and italy today\" this was written in 1931 two years before hitler came to power dr einstein believed that a socialist planned economy was the only way to eliminate the inequalities of capitalism however he fully recognized that \"planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual\" his love for the oppressed also led him to become a strong supporter of zionism in november 1952 following the death of chaim weizmann dr einstein was asked if he would accept the presidency of israel he replied that he was deeply touched by the offer but that he was not suited for the position he never undertook functions he could not fulfill to his satisfaction he said and he felt he was not qualified in the area of human relationships chairman of atomic unit on aug 6 1945 when the world was electrified with the news that an atomic bomb had exploded over japan the significance of relativity was intuitively grasped by the millions from then on the destiny of mankind hung on a thin mathematical thread dr einstein devoted much of his time and energy in an attempt to arouse the world consciousness to its dangers he became the chairman of the emergency committee of atomic scientists organized to make the american people aware of the potential horrors of atomic warfare and the necessity for the international control of atomic energy he believed that real peace could be achieved only by total disarmament and the establishment of a \"restricted world government\" a \"supranational judicial and executive body empowered to decide questions of immediate concern to the security of the nations\" \"the hydrogen bomb\" he said in 1950 \"appears on the public horizon as a probably attainable goal * * * if successful radioactive poisoning of the atmosphere and hence annihilation of any life on earth has been brought within the range of technical possibilities\" he found recreation from his labors in playing the grand piano that stood in the solitary den in the garret of his residence much of his leisure time too was spent in playing the violin he was especially fond of playing trios and quartets with musical friends \"in my life\" he said once explaining his great love for music \"the artistically visionary plays no mean role after all the work of a research scientist germinates upon the soil of imagination of vision just as an artist arrives at his conceptions partly by intuition so a scientist must also have a certain amount of intuition\" while he did not believe in a formal dogmatic religion dr einstein like all true mystics was of a deeply religious nature he referred to it as the cosmic religion which he defined as a seeking on the part of the individual who feels it \"to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance\" \"i assert\" he wrote for the new york times on nov 9 1930 \"that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and the noblest driving force behind scientific research no one who does not appreciate the terrific exertions and above all the devotion without which pioneer creation in scientific thought cannot come into being can judge the strength of the feeling out of which alone such work turned away as it is from immediate practical life can grow\" \"the most beautiful and profound emotion we can experience\" he wrote \"is the mystical it is the source of all true art and science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead: his eyes are closed this insight into the mystery of life coupled though it be with fear also has given rise to religion to know that what is impenetrable to us really exists manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their primitive forms--this knowledge this feeling is at the center of true religiousness in this sense and in this sense only i belong in the ranks of devoutly religious men \"i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation whose purposes are modeled after our own--a god in short who is but a reflection of human fraility neither can i believe that the individual survives the death of his body although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotism it is enough for me to contemplate the mystery of conscious life perpetuating itself through all eternity to reflect upon the marvelous structure of the universe which we can dimly perceive and to try humbly to comprehend even an infinitesimal part of the intelligence manifested in nature \"my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds that deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe forms my idea of god\" \"the most incomprehensible thing about the world\" he said on another occasion \"is that it is comprehensible\"',\n",

for two weeks his heart weakness had already given rise to anxiety which was greatly accentuated yesterday he died in his country villa about thirty miles from moscow at the age of 68 gorky had become one of the most popular figures in the ussr in recent years as he gradually passed from a sympathizer to one of the warmest supporters of the soviet regime he played a leading role at the international writers congress in moscow in the summer of 1934 his photograph in the congress hall was nearly as large as stalin although he did not participate in politics directly and was not a member of the bolshevist party he championed the soviet cause unequivocally tverskaya street one of the leading thoroughfares of moscow was named gorky street in his honor there will be a great public funeral on saturday or sunday and the body will lie in state in moscow for twenty-four hours previously tribute from london london june 18--the times of london in an appreciation of maxim gorky says: \"if any of his works survive as literature and not merely as documents in the stages of the russian revolution they may be not his novels and short stories for which he became famous in early life but the odd unchronicled volumes of reminiscence on which he worked when his health permitted after the downfall of the old regime collectively called \\'my universities\\' they make as fascinating a gallery of curious portraits and pictures of outlandish ways of life as can be found in the works of dickens at his most fantastic \"the success of his plays was probably due more to admirable presentation by the moscow art theatre than to intrinsic merit\" comment from shaw london june 18--george bernard shaw informed of the death of maxim gorky said today: \"i dare say it time for all us nineteenth century writers to clear out you\\'d better prepare my obituary you never know\" triumphal return to russia maxim gorky return to russia in 1928 was something in the nature of a triumphant parade honors--more honors than for any other man in soviet russia--were showered upon the author the ancient city of nizhni novgorod lost its old name and was called gorky in 1932 the largest airplane in the world at the time was named after the author of \"chelkash\" it was wrecked in 1935 the main literary institute in the ussr has been called the maxim gorky institute gorky more recent writings include plays like \"dostigayev\" and \"yegor bulevitch\" and novels or historical works like \"other fires\" \"bystander\" and \"the magnet\" although his influence on the mass of the russian people has been enormous the new school of soviet writers has rebelled to a certain extent against his somewhat ponderous writings of later years his fame at the turn of the century was international in later years he has been more of a semi-political figure in soviet russia gorky opened the first congress of soviet writers in moscow in august 1934 it was estimated in 1933 that his books had a circulation of 10000000 copies in russia alexis maximovitch pleshkov took the name of maxim gorky meaning \"maxim the bitter\" or \"the bitter one\" when he started to write he was born in nizhni novgorod russia march 14 1868 the son of a journeyman upholsterer his rise in the world of literature was in every way extraordinary as will be seen from the chronology which gorky once submitted to an editor who asked for his autobiography this is what he sent to the editor: 1868--born at nizhni novgorod 1878--shoemaker boy 1879--apprentice to a designer painting ikons 1880--cabin boy on a volga steamer where the ship cook taught him to read 1883--worked in a biscuit factory 1884--porter 1885--baker boy 1886--dummy in a village theatre 1887--fruit seller 1888--attempted suicide 1889--railway employe 1890--clerk to an advocate where he learned to write 1891--operative in a salt mill; later vagabond 1892--wrote his first novel \"maker chudra\" 1903--celebrity and riches abandoned by his parents when only 5 years old gorky was abandoned by his parents and was cared for by his grandfather described as a miserly and brutal old man the lot of the nomad which he immortalized in later years appeared to be his destiny desperate struggles with cold and hunger neglect and misery were his lot from his earliest days he was compelled to leave school when he was taken down with cholera and he never returned his father contracted the same illness and died and upon gorky recovery he found that his mother had died of consumption the grandparent informed his convalescent boy that he had lost his hoarded wealth and that he must go to work long and dreary days followed as the shoemaker apprentice he decided that the life of a drudge with its weary hours and slums dark cellars and otherwise sordid environment could be forsaken forever by running away and this he did: tramping about the volga region he chanced upon captain mikail samouir an old seafaring man who liked the bright and companionable vagabond the captain an educated man offered to teach the youth to read but at first gorky hated books and it took him a long time to acquire an appreciation of the beauties stored in the books the captain offered him at first he read the bible then the arabian nights and at length became fascinated with the works of the russian masters of the day when he realized how ignorant he was he sought an education he had read somewhere that leo tolstoy got his education at the university of kazan so at the age of 15 he bade the captain good-bye and set out for kazan he was destined to disappointment at the end of his journey for to his chagrin he learned for the first time that an education such as he desired had to be bought he therefore went to work in a bakeshop earning the sum of 3 rubles per month--$150 in the coin of the united states immortalizes dingy bakeshop in his short story \"twenty-one and one other\" he immortalized the miserable and dingy bakeshop with its ceaselessly toiling bakers and fiery tongues leaping from the bake oven fantastic pictures set his imagination aglow for he had heard of the city of tiflis with its semi-barbaric inhabitants he left the bakeshop bound for the crimea but apparently on this attempt he did not get far a stranger stopped him as he lounged about the university preparatory to taking his departure the man was a lawyer who after hearing the story of the impetuous boy offered him employment gorky became a clerk in the law office and then followed long days of hard study finally he parted from his benefactor and arrived in tiflis in 1892 where he found employment in a railroad shop there he wrote his first short story but his best work in this line was not done until some years later when he met vladimir korolenko the famous russian short-story writer unlike most russian writers gorky was received with great enthusiasm he found an echo within the hearts of the multitude all over the world his work began to meet with approval as it was translated into many languages following his first story gorky attracted wider attention by his tale called \"chelkash\" this was followed by a series of stories in which he sketched with realistic success the life of the bosniakl or tramp his favorite type however was the man in revolt against society through his years of association with that class he wrote from personal knowledge and easily enlisted the sympathy of his readers he also produced some plays with high ideals such as \"at the lowest depths\" which met with great success in moscow an exile for eight years while gorky cultivated the art of expressing revolutionary ideas in his books without actually giving the censor an excuse to suppress them he fell into disastrous conflict with the authorities when later he engaged actively in socialistic anti-government propaganda several times he was cast into prison because of his seditious utterances and after incarceration at riga in january 1905 he virtually became an exile for eight years he came to america in the spring of 1906 when it was learned that the \"mme gorky\" with whom he was travelling was in reality mlle andreieva an actress and not legally married to the revolutionist a revulsion of sentiment set in and society refused to have anything more to do with him despite the explanation that under the russian laws it had been impossible to obtain a divorce from his wife with whom he had not lived for years admission to new york hotels was refused him and finally after a period of seclusion he left america bitterly denouncing the country in 1907 while living in the shadow of death from tuberculosis at capri italy gorky married the actress in 1913 he was included in an amnesty conceded by the czar but at first declined to avail himself of it in 1914 however he returned to russia soon thereafter the world war started although 46 years old with health undermined and a supposedly confirmed pacifist gorky enlisted in the russian army as a private and served at the front in galicia he said a european disaster would be brought about if germany won the war and he was willing to sacrifice his principles to avert such a catastrophe attacked bolsheviki when the revolution broke out in 1917 gorky was as ardent a revolutionist as any and was active in politics as editor of his revived organ svobodnaia zhizn free life which had been previously suppressed because of its revolutionary tendencies when kerensky was overthrown gorky found himself in bitter disagreement with the bolsheviki and attacked them almost daily in editorials and bulletins issued over his name his opposition did not last long however and he was soon won over to the bolshevist cause his adherence to the soviet cause was questioned at various times due to temporary quarrels with the powers that be but generally speaking he never wavered in his support of the principles for which the bolsheviki stood in 1918 he was appointed chief of the soviet bureau of propaganda and early the next year he was elected a member of the petrograd soviet his wife became an official of the department of education gorky political connection with the soviet ended in 1924 when either because his health was bad or because he felt himself temporarily out of sympathy with the regime he left russia for germany france and italy faithful to soviet creed as a matter of fact gorky was to show himself by his later actions and statements to be heartily in accord with soviet principles when the tenth anniversary of the bolshevist regime was celebrated gorky sent a letter of greeting to the soviet government while in russia gorky abandoned his literary work only to take it up again when he was abroad for a year or two after leaving russia he was believed to be slowly dying of his tubercular trouble but after purchasing a villa in sorrento italy and taking up his residence there he recovered his health completely his most important literary work composed at sorrento was his autobiography written in the form of a diary but he also wrote several novels and plays considered by critics to be as fine as any of his early work on his sixtieth birthday which occurred in march 1928 the soviet government honored him by issuing a special set of postage stamps bearing his portrait gorky was the first writer so honored in russia',\n",
       " 'in the decade following world war i america luxuriated in the golden era of sports and its greatest collection of super-athletes: babe ruth and ty cobb in baseball jack dempsey and gene tunney in boxing bill tilden in tennis red grange in football and bobby jones in golf many of their records have been broken now and others are destined to be broken but one sports experts agree may outlast them--bobby jones grand slam of 1930 jones an intense unspoiled young man started early on the road to success at the age of 10 he shot a 90 for 18 holes at 11 he was down to 80 and at 12 he shot a 70 at 9 he played against men at 14 he won a major men tournament and at 21 he was united states open champion at 28 he achieved the grand slam--victories in one year in the united states open british open united states amateur and british amateur championships at that point he retired from tournament golf a nation that idolized him for his success grew to respect him even more for his decision to treat golf as a game rather than a way of life this respect grew with the years \"first come my wife and children\" he once explained \"next comes my profession--the law finally and never as a life in itself comes golf\" his record aside from the grand slam was magnificent he won the united states open championship four times 1923 1926 1929 and 1930 the british open three times 1926 1927 and 1930 and the united states amateur five times 1924 1925 1927 1928 and 1930 \"jones is as truly the supreme artist of golf as paderewski is the supreme artist of the piano\" george h greenfield wrote in the new york times in 1930 felt the tension success did not come easily though jones was cool and calculating outwardly he seethed inside he could never eat properly during a major tournament the best his stomach would hold was dry toast and tea the pressure of tournament competition manifested itself in other ways too everyone expected jones to win every time he played including atlanta friends who often bet heavily on him he escaped the unending pressure by retiring from competition \"why should i punish myself like this over a golf tournament\" he once asked \"sometimes i\\'d pass my mother and dad on the course look at them and not even see them because i was so concentrated on the game afterward it made a fellow feel a little silly\" the quality of the man projected itself too he was worshiped as a national hero in scotland the birthplace of golf scots would come for miles around to watch him play in 1936 on a visit he made an unannounced trip to the royal and ancient golf club at st andrews for a quiet morning round with friends there were 5000 spectators at the first tee and 7000 at the 18th businesses closed as word spread that \"our bobby is back\" in 1927 when he tapped in his final putt to win the british open there an old scot stood by the green and muttered: \"the man canna be human\" off the course jones was convivial in a quiet way he was a good friend and always the gentleman though he had full command of strong language when desired he had a fine sense of humor and he laughed easily he smoked cigarettes and drank bourbon he was besieged by people who wanted to play a social round of golf with him when they talked with him it was always golf he managed to tolerate their one-sided approach to life he also learned to put up with the name of bobby which he hated he preferred bob he was not always so serene as a youngster he had a reputation for throwing clubs when everything was not going right when jim barnes the 1921 united states open champion watched him let off steam he said: \"never mind that club-throwing and the beatings he taking defeat will make him great he not satisfied now with a pretty good shot he has to be perfect that the way a good artist must feel\" the defeats barnes spoke of were frequent in the early years for young jones though he had the game of a man had the emotions of a growing boy he never won the big tournaments until he got his temper under control at 18 he learned that his greatest opponent was himself he was playing at toledo one day with harry vardon the great english professional and was his usual brash self they were about even when jones dribbled a shot into a bunker hoping to ease his embarrassment he turned to vardon and asked: \"did you ever see a worse shot\" \"no\" replied the crusty vardon it as the only word he spoke to jones all day jones matured so much so that o b keeler an atlanta sports writer and his long-time boswell once wrote: \"he has more character than any champion in our history\" he also had the dream of every golfer--a picture swing no one taught it to him for he never took a golf lesson in his life he learned the swing by watching stewart maiden a scottish professional at the atlanta athletic club course he would follow maiden for a few holes then run home and mimic the swing his putting was famous so was his putter a rusty goosenecked club known as calamity jane his strength was driving putting and an ability to get out of trouble he was an imaginative player and he never hesitated to take a chance in fact he seldom hesitated on any shot and he earned an unfair reputation as a mechanical golfer the game often baffled him \"there are times\" he once said \"when i feel that i know less about what i\\'m doing on a golf course than anyone else in the world\" when he was an infant doctors were not sure that he would survive let alone play golf he had a serious digestive ailment until he was 5 and he stayed home while other children played in his later years he was crippled by syringomyelia a chronic disease of the spinal cord and he had circulation and heart trouble robert tyre jones jr named for his grandfather was born on st patrick day 1902 in atlanta his father was a star outfielder at the university of georgia and the youngster first love was baseball he also tried tennis at the age of 9 he settled down to golf his parents had taken up the game after moving to a cottage near the east lake course of the atlanta athletic club young bobby would walk around the course watch the older folk play and learn by example he was only 6 years old a scrubby youngster with skinny arms and legs when he won a six-hole tournament at 9 he was the club junior champion in philadelphia tourney he was 14 when he journeyed to the merion cricket club near philadelphia for his first united states amateur championship he was a chunky lad of 5 feet 4 inches and 165 pounds and somewhat knock-kneed he was wearing his first pair of long trousers after qualifying for match play he defeated eben m byers a former champion in the first round he beat frank dyer a noted player at the time in the second round after losing five of the first six holes then he lost to robert a gardner the defending champion 5 and 3 in 1922 he reached the semifinals of the united states amateur before losing that ended what he called his seven lean years next came what keeler called \"the eight fat years\" as jones finally achieved the heights all this time golf was a sidelight to education jones wanted to be an engineer and he earned bachelor and master degrees in engineering at georgia tech then he decided to become a lawyer he went to harvard and earned another bachelor degree then to emory university in atlanta for a bachelor of laws degree in 1928 he joined his father law firm in atlanta in 1924 jones decided that he was worrying too much about his opponent in match-play man against man competition he vowed to play for pars and forget about his opponent this was a turning point in his career he started to win match-play competition that year at merion pa he won the united states amateur for the first time in the final he defeated george von elm by the overwhelming score of 9 and 8 also in 1924 he married mary malone his high school sweetheart in 1929 jones had a close call in the united states open at the winged foot golf club mamaroneck ny he sank a 12-foot sloping sidehill putt on the last green to tie al espinosa the next day jones won their 36-hole title playoff by 23 strokes then came 1930 and the grand slam lloyds of london quoted odds of 50 to 1 that jones wouldn\\'t win the world four major tournaments that year he won them first came the british amateur he started his opening match by shooting 3 4 3 and 2 in the final he beat roger wethered 7 and 6 next was the british open at hoylake england and his 72-hole score of 291 won that championship back home jones got his sternest test of the year in the united states open at interlachen near minneapolis there were 15000 spectators in the gallery as he played the par-4 18th hole he got a birdie 3 by sinking a 40-foot undulating putt and his 287 won by two strokes he had become the first man to win three of the four major titles in one year the last of the grand-slam tournaments the united states amateur at merion was almost anticlimactic no one doubted for the moment that jones would win he captured the qualifying medal he routed jess sweetser 9 and 8 in the semifinal round and in the final he defeated gene homans 8 and 7 the crowd surged around him so wildly that it took a detachment of united states marines to get him out safely soon after he retired from tournament play and made a series of golf motion pictures the only time he ever made money from the game later he became a vice president of a g spalding & bros the sporting goods manufacturer he became a wealthy lawyer and soft-drink bottler and a business and social leader in atlanta he never played serious tournament golf again he didn\\'t seem to mind \"golf is like eating peanuts\" he said \"you can play too much or too little i\\'ve become reconciled to the fact that i\\'ll never play as well as i used to\" a few years later jones and the late architect alister mackensie designed the augusta national golf course in georgia in 1934 the masters tournament was started there and in jones lifetime many golf people considered it the most important tournament of all jones played in the first masters and in several thereafter but he was never among the leaders he always wore his green jacket signifying club membership at victory ceremonies and he served as club president he became strong enough to rip a pack of playing cards across the middle but his health deteriorated he underwent spinal surgery in 1948 and 1950 he was forced to use one cane then two canes and then a wheelchair and his weight dropped to less than 100 pounds he last saw the masters in 1967 he was a close friend of dwight d eisenhower and the president often used his cottage adjacent to the augusta national course for golfing vacations during his first term in office the president painted a 40-by-32-inch oil portrait of jones at the peak of his game on the back was printed by hand: \"bob--from his friend dde 1953\" in january of 1953 three months after a heart attack jones was honored at golf house the united states golf association headquarters in manhattan augusta national members including general eisenhower had donated another oil portrait to be hung at golf house a highlight of the ceremony was the reading of a letter from the president \"those who have been fortunate enough to know him\" the letter said \"realize that his fame as a golfer is transcended by his inestimable qualities as a human being  his gift to his friends is the warmth that comes from unselfishness superb judgement nobility of character unwavering loyalty to principle\"',\n",
       " 'grover cleveland twenty-second president of the untied states and the only democrat to hold the office of chief executive since the time of buchanan was born at caldwell essex county n j march 18 1837 he was the third child of the rev richard falley cleveland and anna neal cleveland and he was christened stephen grover though the first of his given names was never used the family of which the late ex-president was a member dated back in this country to moses cleaveland a native of ipswich suffolk county england who emigrated to massachusetts in 1635 aaron cleveland a great grandson of moses and the great-great- grandfather of grover was the first of the line to drop from the name the superfluous \"a\" he was an intimate friend of benjamin franklin and died in franklin house in philadelphia whither he had gone for medical treatment richard falley cleveland the ex-president father was a graduate of yale and was ordained into the presbyterian ministry in 1829 marrying in the same year his wife anna neal was of irish and german descent the daughter of a book merchant of baltimore thus grover cleveland came of a mixed stock almost typically american formed of a union of english irish and german at the time of grover cleveland birth his father was the pastor of a church at caldwell the former occupant of the parsonage had been the rev stephen grover after whom the son of dr grover successor was called the name stephen was dropped early in boyhood but much was said and written about it at the time of mr cleveland first nomination for the presidency when mr cleveland was but 4 years old his father accepted a call to fayetteville near syracuse this state where the family lived nine years moving thence to clinton oneida county for three years and afterward to holland patent a small village fifteen miles north of utica the elder cleveland died within three weeks of entering upon his new ministry at the latter place leaving a widow and nine children the widow continued to live there until her death in 1882 and the place was also the home for many years of grover favorite sister rose elizabeth the writer worked for $50 a year both at fayetteville and at clinton grover cleveland had the advantage of being able to attend though not with strict regularity an academy at the age of 14 he was a clerk in a small store in fayetteville at a salary of $50 a year he was to have received double the amount the second year but the family moved away much to the boy disappointment he was preparing to enter hamilton college at the time of his father death being then 17 years old from that time on he was compelled to earn his own living and to aid his mother at that time 1853 grover brother william who was a teacher in the new york institute for the blind was made principal of the institution and grover obtained an appointment as his assistant teaching the blind at that time was an exceedingly arduous process as there were no text books grover cleveland remained but a year in the institution when he determined to study law and returned to his mother home at holland patent this visit home as later developments proved was the turning point in his life a neighbor ingham townsend urged him to enter the ministry but the young man was intent on studying law and borrowed $25 from mr townsend wherewith to reach cleveland ohio where he believed he could obtain employment in a lawyer office he decided however to visit his uncle lewis f allen at buffalo before going on to cleveland mr allen was engaged at that time in writing a series of books and employed young grover to help him paying him for six weeks\\' work the sum of $60 later however young cleveland services were acknowledged in the preface of one of the volumes published in 1861 in the meanwhile however mr allen persuaded his nephew to give up the idea of a trip further west and in august 1855 grover cleveland began the study of law in the office of rogers bowes & rogers in buffalo his actual position being that of copyist and clerk he pursued his studies arduously and four years later in 1859 he was admitted to the bar he remained with his employers for three years after being admitted however receiving at first $600 a year and later $1000 this was in 1863 and the civil war had reached its critical stage years later there was considerable criticism of mr cleveland action in not having served his country in the war on his behalf his friends have asserted that from the time of his first employment in buffalo a part of his earnings had been dispatched regularly to his mother and that when the war broke out he found himself in the position of having to decide whether he should continue to contribute to his mother support or take up arms in defense of his country it was decided eventually that his two younger brothers should join the northern army while he should remain in buffalo and take care of his mother this was done later mr cleveland obtained the services of a substitute to pay whom he had to borrow money entry into public life mr cleveland professional life really began in 1863 in january of that year he was appointed assistant district attorney of erie county his new position took him from the narrow paths he had been following and brought him into contact with men of affairs enabling him to obtain a wealth of experience which was of great use to him in later years as a pleader in court he obtained his first grounding in public speaking developing early a directness of speech which marked his utterances ever afterward owing to the fact that the district attorney torrance lived twenty-five miles from the city mr cleveland had perhaps more than his share of the office work but he was glad of the opportunity; anxious for work that would give him experience; extremely desirous of a thorough training in his chosen profession among the prominent and able politicians in buffalo at that time with whom young cleveland came constantly in contact were albert haller tracy ex-president fillmore nathan k hall who had been fillmore postmaster general and congressman solomon g haven he had been appointed as a democrat and a democrat he remained always and unwaveringly when in 1865 the district attorney died he although only 28 years old received the nomination erie county being strongly republican at that time he was defeated his opponent in the race the first political race of his career was lyman k bass a warm personal friend entering private practice mr cleveland formed a partnership with isaac v vanderpool and the business of the firm increased rapidly in 1867 he declined an appointment as assistant united states district attorney for northern new york and two years later formed a law partnership with a p lanning and oscar folsom the father of frances folsom whom he afterward married after this partnership had done a prosperous business for two years mr cleveland withdrew to accept the nomination for sheriff of erie county to which office he was elected the acceptance of this nomination was a matter to which he gave deep thought finally having made the choice he told his friends that he had done so in order that he might have more time for reading and professional study; an opportunity to save a modest competency and at the same time retain his professional relations mr cleveland served as sheriff for three years at the end of which time he believed himself a sounder advocate and a man of graver and maturer intellect while in office two of his brothers who had served in the army were lost at sea in the burning of the steamer missouri off the island of abaco this was in 1872 forming a partnership with lyman k bass and wilson s bissell mr cleveland again took up the practice of law later mr bass place in the firm was taken by george j sicard mr cleveland personal success as a lawyer was considerable and he remained with the firm until 1881 when he accepted the nomination for mayor of buffalo this nomination was largely the outcome of his own deep interest in politics which had gradually developed during the years of his residence in buffalo until he had become one of the chief counselors of his party in his home town he was elected by the then unusual majority of 3530 the largest that had ever been cast for a candidate for that office up to that time the veto his weapon early in his career as an elected officer mr cleveland became known as the \"veto mayor\" afterward he was know as the \"veto governor\" and the \"veto president\" he wielded the power of the veto with great freedom and sometimes quite unexpectedly his first veto astonished the state though it had to do with a comparatively small matter an appropriation of $500 by the city council for the observance of decoration day had been authorized from certain moneys set aside for the celebration of independence day and there was an ordinance against using funds set aside for one purpose for another hence the veto shortly after this came the so-called \"plain-speech veto\" which concerned a street- cleaning contract awarded at a price of $422500 for five years though an unsuccessful bidder had offered to do the work for $100000 less after a successful administration as mayor mr cleveland was put forward as a candidate for the nomination for governor the buffalo daily news formerly a republican newspaper being the first to announce his candidacy among his opponents in the race for the nomination were roswell p flower and gen henry w slocum after a spirited canvass he obtained the nomination largely through the votes of the tammany representatives who had failed of admission to the convention of the year previous mr cleveland was nominated on the third ballot mr cleveland was elected governor of new york state by a majority of 151000 and a plurality over the republican candidate charles j folger of 192000 the republican party that year was split by factional fights and there was considerable dissension over federal interference in state politics in his first message as governor mr cleveland urged the removal of restrictions on the canals of the state and had the pleasure of seeing his views carried out he also devoted much of the message to the matter of health the supervision of banks schools and charitable institutions and to the question of municipal governments which was just then attracting widespread attention on this score he urged against divided responsibility as governor he added to his reputation for vetoing measures unexpectedly at one time declining to sign a bill appropriating money for a soldiers\\' monument declaring that though the object was an admirable and patriotic one he could not forget that the money must come from the pockets of the taxpayers and all that justified the collection of such funds was the safety and substantial welfare of the citizens as before him tilden and seymour had found the governorship of this state a stepping stone to the nomination for the presidency so with cleveland he met with opposition of no mean order from roswell p flower gen slocum and abram s hewitt when the convention met in chicago with the names of gen palmer of illinois senator mcdonald of indiana thomas hendricks of indiana john g carlisle william r morrison judge truman and samuel j randall before it it was discovered that the party was so divided that to unite on any one of these men was practically impossible the delegates turned their eyes then to cleveland and he was nominated with great enthusiasm mr hendricks being named for the second place on the ticket thus the preconcerted arrangement of one man from the east and the other from the middle west was carried out satisfactorily in the campaign that followed mr cleveland adopted an unusual stand by refusing to make speeches he made but two during the whole of the time one at newark and one at bridgeport each was brief in the extreme this was the campaign in which the alliterative sentence of the rev samuel d burchard in a speech made at the fifth avenue hotel representing the democrats as associated with \"rum romanism and rebellion\" played such havoc with the chances of james g blaine there were four tickets in the field and the popular vote stood: cleveland dem 4874986 blaine rep 4851981 butler labor and greenback 175370 st john pro 150369 mr cleveland received a majority of 37 in the electoral college first presidential term the first term of grover cleveland as president of the united states was not made notable by any striking events the foreign relations of the country on the whole were tranquil the dispute with mexico over the imprisonment of cutting was annoying but comparatively trivial the dispute with italy and austria-hungary over the nomination of a m kiely as minister was more dignified both courts considered kiely person non grata; italy because he had denounced king victor emmanuel for his treatment of the pope and austria-hungary because his wife was a jewess the president administered a stinging rebuke by refusing to appoint any minister to vienna for a year two treaties were made during the first cleveland term; one with england providing for the extradition of criminals for a greater number of offenses and the other with great britain and canada for the purpose of settling long existing controversies between the latter country and the united states home affairs were administered with success the enlargement of the navy being given particular attention under the administration of william c whitney as secretary of the navy it was in this term in the general belief that the foundation of the navy as the efficient body of fighting ships which dealt with spain was laid a navy large enough to dignify the dictates of the country was with cleveland a doctrine of the first importance the term too was marked by a restoration of good feeling and relations between the north and the south the defeat of cleveland by harrison in 1888 is generally attributed to his tariff message of the year before but there are those who differ from this view declaring that if it be true that the president views on that question did accomplish the defeat of the party in 1888 it undoubtedly brought victory in 1892 it is freely asserted that the party lost because it could not hold states that were naturally democratic owing to factional differences and the personal ambitions of some politicians cleveland was defeated in the electoral college but his tariff utterances mush have found favor with the people for in the popular vote he had a plurality over harrison of 100476 mr cleveland spent the four years between his first and second terms in practicing law in this city succeeding remarkably and all the time abstaining from the discussion of public questions his second term will undoubtedly be regarded always as one of the most important peace periods in the history of the country the president was called upon to deal with almost every question of importance that had at different times perplexed the national councils pensions civil service reform and the silver question were among the chief of these perhaps among home affairs his action in making a contract with j p morgan and august belmont for the immediate purchase of sufficient gold to prevent the threatened adoption of the silver standard was the most important of all considered in relation to the man it raised a great cry of denunciation but his friends ably defended the president declaring that he had adopted the only means of saving the nation from dishonorable bankruptcy upheld queen liliuokalani it was perhaps in his foreign policy however that mr cleveland second administration was the more brilliant his disposition of the case of queen liliuokalani was considered admirable even by some of his enemies he felt sure that the minister to hawaii stevens had acted in a lawless manner in landing a detachment of troops from boston and recognizing the provisional government the day after the old government had been overthrown and while it was still able to hold its own except against the arms of the united states and he said so unequivocally; though congress disagreed and upheld stevens of even greater importance was his action in the venezuelan boundary dispute; perhaps the best known of his official actions in his message of dec 17 1895 he gave expression to the broadest view of the monroe doctrine that had ever been enunciated in the diplomatic history of the country the correspondence between this country and great britain over the matter had lasted a year and little had been done there had seemed to be no cause for tension between the countries but the cleveland message setting forth clearly and determinedly the attitude of the united states was received with amazement and the shock of arms between the two old-time foes uncle sam and john bull was looked for reading like an invitation to war the message really made for peace as a result of it the question was settled once for all and the power of the united states in the western hemisphere firmly established grover cleveland had married on june 2 1886 at the white house frances folsom the daughter of his former law partner she became the youngest and was accredited with being one of the most beautiful mistresses of the white house at the time of her marriage she was 22 ruth the first child of the union was born in this city on oct 3 1891 the second child esther was born in the white house sept 9 1893 during president cleveland second term mr cleveland retired to private life on march 4 1897 making his home at princeton n j and withdrawing almost entirely from discussion of public affairs though at one point he opposed vigorously the policy of \"imperialism\" declaring it contrary to the practice of the country since the time of washington mr cleveland came somewhat prominently before the public again at the time of the insurance scandals when the equitable life assurance society passed from the control of james hazen hyde into the hands of thomas f ryan mr ryan set paul morton at the head of the active management of the company but chose also a committee of three whose duty it should be to guard the policy holders\\' interest this committee was headed by grover cleveland his associates being morgan j o\\'brien and george westinghouse the sagacity of mr ryan in choosing mr cleveland for such work was recognized at once and beyond all question the presence of the former president on the committee went a long way toward allaying the fears of the policy holders the country over and quieting the tumult that the disclosures of the former management practices had raised to a certain extent mr cleveland became identified with the life insurance business from that time on last year in february he was chosen for the position of chairman of the executive committee of the association of life insurance presidents at a salary of $25000 a year in the meanwhile too he had acted as rebate referee for the mutual equitable and new york life insurance companies and this work constituted the chief business activity of his later life from time to time during the last years at princeton mr cleveland in interviews and otherwise reiterated the doctrines that brought him fame in his earlier years and occasionally expressed trenchant views on current topics',\n",
       " 'presiding over the supreme court for 16 years--from 1953 to 1969--earl warren championed the constitution as the vigorous protector of the individual rights and equality of all americans reflecting the dynamics of social change in the nation and profoundly affecting them mr warren court amid much dispute elaborated a doctrine of fairness in such areas as criminal justice voting rights legislative districting employment housing transportation and education in so doing the chief justice of the united states contributed greatly to a reshaping of the country social and political institutions \"i would like the court to be remembered as the people court\" he remarked on his retirement expressing his strong sense of indignation over wrongs done to obscure citizens in the government name this was a quite different attitude from his earlier law-and-order views as a california prosecutor; but mr warren had become more liberal with age and perspective \"on the court i saw [things] in a different light\" he once explained liberties reinforced the impact of the warren court was cumulative and mr warren stature grew perceptibly over 16 years the parts that constituted the whole were embodied in a series of decisions that had the collective effect of reinforcing popular liberties among these were rulings that: outlawed school segregation enunciated the one-man one-vote doctrine made most of the bill of rights binding on the states curbed wiretapping upheld the right to be secure against \"unreasonable\" searches and seizures buttressed the right to counsel underscored the right to a jury trial barred racial discrimination in voting in marriage laws in the use of public parks airports and bus terminals and in housing sales and rentals extended the boundaries of free speech ruled out compulsory religious exercises in public schools restored freedom of foreign travel knocked out the application of both the smith and the mccarran acts--both designed to curb \"subversive\" activities held that federal prisoners could sue the government for injuries sustained in jail said that wages could not be garnished without a hearing liberalized residency requirements for welfare recipients sustained the right to disseminate and receive birth control information although mr warren did not write the opinions in all these cases he bore the brunt of the criticism that many of them aroused this criticism came from policemen and prosecutors; politicians; white supremacists; conservatives; and indirectly from the nixon white house the cry from the nixon administration that the warren court \"coddled criminals\" and fostered permissiveness\" misled many people according to mr warren in an interview mr warren bristled visibly as he recalled charges that he had been \"soft\" on crime \"i wasn\\'t ofter\\' on crime that i ever was\" he declared \"all we did on the court was to apply the constitution which says that any defendant is entitled to due process and to certain basic rights\" some critics of mr warren wanted him removed and at one time there were a spate of billboard and bumper signs that said \"impeach earl warren\" of the signs mr warren said \"it was kind of an honor to be accused by the john birch society [the right-wing group that opposed him strenuously] it was a little rough on my wife but it never bothered me\" although impeachment was clearly a minority movement there was never even a house resolution there were conservatives some lawyers among them who agreed with president eisenhower when he called the warren appointment \"the biggest damned-fool mistake i ever made\" he was alluding to the court desegregation decisions which provoked lawless dissension among many southern whites before they became reconciled to laws fostering racial equality many observers believed that the desegregation rulings starting with brown v board of education of topeka in 1954 were the warren court most important because they led to a readjustment of long-standing racial imbalances in the country mr warren himself however regarded the redistricting cases as the most significant he expressed his feelings this way: \"if everyone in this country has an opportunity to participate in his government on equal terms with everyone else and can share in electing representatives who will be truly representative of the entire community and not some special interest then most of the problems that we are confronted with would be solved through the political process rather than through the courts\" if the one-man one-vote principle had been in effect much earlier in our history according to mr warren \"our court would not have been compelled to decide big cases just on the bare bones of the constitution on the bare bones of the civil war amendments\" if the 15th amendment assuring the right to vote regardless of race had been translated into legislation giving the black man the right to vote \"by this time racial problems should have been solved by the political process\" he said adding: \"if baker v carr [the leading re-districting case] had been in existence 50 years ago we would have saved ourselves acute racial troubles but as it was the court just had to decide\" the essence of mr warren and the court position on one man one vote--a doctrine that transformed the political map of the nation--was set forth in reynolds v sims at issue was whether factors other than equal representation of voters could be considered in electing state legislators assuming that members of one house would be elected from districts of equal populations could members of the other house represent geographical areas of varying densities in order to assure a voice to sparsely settled localities and minority interests because to do so would give some persons more influence than others mr warren replied with a firm \"no\" \"legislators represent people not trees or acres\" he wrote \"legislators are elected by voters not farms or cities or economic interests\" he saw no reason he added why \"history alone nor economic or other sorts of group interests\" could justify giving \"one person a greater voice in government than any other person\" desegregation rulings \"the overriding objective\" he remarked \"must be substantial equality among the various districts so that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the state\" as a result of this and other rulings--and sometimes prodded by lower courts--states redrew their legislative districts and many reviewed congressional boundaries ranking just below redistricting in mr warren estimation came the school desegregation rulings that started with the brown case in 1954 this historic decision was one of 45 in which the warren court overruled prior supreme court holdings and set in motion profound changes in the country racial relations mr warren handling of the brown case to achieve unanimity inside the court illustrated the qualities that made him in the minds of many lawyers an outstanding chief justice describing what happened he said: \"ordinarily the justices at our friday conferences stated their positions offered debate and then voted but in brown we were all conscious of the case so i held off a vote from conference to conference while we discussed it if you\\'ll remember brown was argued in the fall of 1953 and i did not call for a vote until the middle of the following february when i was certain we would be unanimous we took one vote and that was it \"i assigned myself to write the decision for it seemed to me that something so important ought to issue over the name of the chief justice of the united states in drafting it i sought to use low-key unemotional language and to keep it short enough so that it could be published in full in every newspaper in the country i kept the text secret it was locked in my safe until i read from the bench\" speaking for the court mr warren brushed aside the \"separate but equal\" doctrine of plessy v ferguson that had been in effect for 58 years basing himself on the 14th amendment declaration that no person should be denied the equal protection of the laws he wrote of black school children: \"to separate them from others because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may effect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to be undone\" this led him to declare: \"we conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of eparate but equal\\' has no place separate educational facilities are inherently equal\" the brown ruling touched off a series of acts of defiance in the south and generated serious tensions in other parts of the country these had largely subsided by 1973 although strong undercurrents of white supremacy were still evident in disputes over the busing of schoolchildren and other racial matters the moral authority of the court which had been severely tested survived from the brown decision flowed a score or more of holdings by the court and by inferior courts that collectively struck down racial inequalities in most areas of public life as a result parks swimming pools bus terminals and housing were desegregated a hundred years after the civil war blacks began to achieve full citizenship rights of the accused ranking third in mr warren mind was a group of criminal cases that expanded protection for the rights of the accused in the view of many lawyers and of mr warren these decisions were often misunderstood as permitting the \"coddling of criminals\" whereas these lawyers contended that the rulings did little more than make specific the words of the constitution \"i think one of the most important cases we had was the gideon case\" mr warren remarked after his retirement \"that was the case that interpreted the constitution to say it meant just exactly what it said that a man was entitled to counsel in a criminal proceeding\" continuing his analysis he said: \"before the case in many places throughout the country a man was afforded counsel if he couldn\\'t pay for it only if he was charged with a capital offense and of course that means that hundreds of thousands of men every year were arrested and tried and perhaps had no legal advice at all the gideon case made it a living thing that every man charged with a serious offense was entitled to counsel at his trial \"then also i think the case of escobedo was a very important case because in that case it was determined that when a man was in jail and asked for his lawyer and his lawyer was available he was entitled to have him there \"then we come to the miranda case and the question arises: if he entitled to a lawyer when his lawyer is present when is he first entitled to a lawyer \"miranda simply said that when the law puts upon a man by putting him in restraint and taking him away from his home and his family and his friends and starts to put him behind bars that then he in the foils of the law in a criminal case and is entitled to have representation of counsel\" mr warren explication his reducing of legalisms to comprehensible language was according to his colleagues typical of the way he presented cases in the court conferences and typical also of the language of his opinions this scanting of law book language led some scholars to doubt his learning but he contended that \"expressing the concepts of the constitution in common language was part of my idea of the court as a people court\" the chief justice was at pains to deny that the court criminal justice decisions had hampered legal law enforcement \"it is always easier to obtain a conviction if you are permitted to use excesses that are prohibited by the constitution\" he said \"i\\'m not softer on crime than i was as a california prosecutor but a lot of things change in 50 years\" he went on \"the third degree called for some restraints so that innocent people were not convicted and all we did was to keep up with the times\" the changing of views actually mr warren votes in the criminal cases illustrated the phenomenon of a man growing more liberal with age he was in succession a crime-busting district attorney a law-and-order state attorney general a progressive governor and a libertarian chief justice his views changed he once said because he saw things \"in a different light\" and in the interview for this article he remarked \"no man can sit on the court over 16 years and remain parochial for he must look out over all the united states\" \"i do not see how a man could be on the court and not change his views substantially over a period of years\" he said one example was his vote early in his term to uphold a gambling conviction that was based on the placing of wiretapping devices in a bookie bedroom mr warren agonized that prosecutors should not be allowed to use the fruits of such practices but he could not bring himself to encroach on a state law-enforcement prerogatives his attitude shifted markedly with later cases starting with the mapp case in 1961 the court made the bill of rights curb on unreasonable search and seizure fully binding on state and local policemen after this ruling the court went on to apply most of the bill of rights to the states \"this was a most significant development\" justice william j brennan jr said in an interview for this article\" ultimately all but three or four of the bill guarantees were laid on the states \"warren was not the chief architect of this development in which [justice hugo l] black and [justice william o] douglas were leaders but the chief helped to make a consensus among several of us\" by the early sixties mr warren was clearly demonstrating an ability to give the court cohesion and direction this leadership was buttressed by the appointment of several liberal justices who tended to see things his way thus the familiar \"warren majority\" of the chief justice and justices arthur j goldberg black brennan and douglas was bolstered by thurgood marshall and abe fortas cordial relationships a mild and genial man mr warren got along well with his colleagues on the bench all men of strong personalities according to both justices brennan and douglas the members of the court often engaged in vigorous disagreements over issues but their personal relations were always cordial one justice recalled however at least one personal clash between mr warren and justice felix frankfurter who had the habit of lobbying his colleagues mr warren acknowledged that mr frankfurter had sometimes been prickly and long-winded but in retrospect he laughed about the justice traits according to mr brennan \"it was incredible how efficiently the chief would conduct the friday conferences leading the discussion of every case on the agenda with a knowledge of each case at his fingertips\" more than many chief justices mr warren removed himself from partisanship and political activity but in one instance he felt obliged to take on albeit reluctantly an extra-judicial task that was the chairmanship of the so-called warren commission which investigated the assassination of president kennedy in november 1963 and concluded that lee harvey oswald acting alone had shot the president in taking the post mr warren yielded to the importunings of president johnson the 10 months of the commission work were \"the unhappiest time of my life\" he said adding that \"to review the terrible happenings of that assassination every day [was] a traumatic experience \"the only reason i undertook the commission was the gravity of the situation\" he recalled \"there was no way of holding a trial for oswald was dead and the country needed to have the facts of the killing brought out but it isn\\'t a good thing for a justice to undertake such duties\" although many disputed or disbelieved the commission findings mr warren was unshaken asserting \"no one has produced any facts that are contrary to the commission conclusions\" mr warren path to the court began in los angeles where he was born march 19 1891 the son of methias h matt warren and crystal hernlund warren his mother was a native of sweden and his father was born in norway the elder warren was a car repairman and inspector for the southern pacific railroad the family moved to bakersfield where after a number of years matt warren slipped into the way of an eccentric who did not live with his family he was bludgeoned to death in 1938 and the case was never solved his son attended public schools in bakersfield played the cornet in bands and orchestras he joined the musicians\\' union in the process and worked at odd jobs--railroad call boy freight hustler truck driver--to meet expenses he went to the university of california getting a bachelor of letters degree in 1912 and a doctorate in jurisprudence in 1914 world war and law he practiced law for several years served as an infantry first lieutenant in world war i and began his public career as deputy city attorney for oakland calif then he became a deputy district attorney for alameda county which embraces the cities of oakland alameda and berkeley in the san francisco bay area his career in both posts was unspectacular but in the 13 years he served as the county district attorney from 1925 to 1938 he emerged as a racket- busting prosecutor even so mr warren was not thought of as brilliant merely thorough none of the convictions he obtained for example was upset on appeal although he was proud of his legal footwork he said later that he had got no personal satisfaction from the convictions \"although i fought vigorously in the cases i prosecuted\" he remarked \"i invariably felt nauseated when the jury brought in a verdict of guilty\" in his years as district attorney mr warren made many friends in the state standing a little over 6 feet and weighing 215 pounds he had a hearty handshake and an easy manner \"hello there\" he would say \"how are you glad to see you!\" he joined the ritual organizations including the whites-only order of elks in those days he said later he accepted without thought the prevailing racial attitudes mr warren had been his party state chairman from 1934 to 1936 and was republican national committeeman when he ran for california attorney general in 1938 at the age of 47 he cross- filled and won three nominations--his party the democratic and the progressive he won election in an otherwise democratic year in four years as attorney general he kept in the public eye with an occasional raid on gambling dens but most of his work was administrative nonetheless he appeared frequently around the state usually with his wife the former mrs nina palmquist meyers a widow whom he had married in 1925 with her son james whom mr warren adopted and the couple five children--virginia earl jr dorothy nina elizabeth and robert--the family was attractive and mr warren was not averse to showing it off \"how can you beat a man with a family like that\" asked one california politician in 1942 mr warren ran for governor and won by defeating the favored democratic nominee governor culbert l olson he proved an amiable and popular governor but not a governmental leader of great distinction or a political leader of great power nonetheless when he sought re- election in 1946 he cross-filed in the primaries and won both the republican and democratic designations the election was a formality in 1950 he was again his party choice but this time he faced james roosevelt the son of the late franklin d roosevelt the roosevelt name however carried no magic and mr warren won by a million votes in between in 1948 he was selected for geopolitical reasons to run for the vice-presidency with gov thomas e dewey of new york they lost to harry s truman and alben w barkley after having convinced many journalists and pundits that they would surely triumph again in 1952 mr warren made a national bid as a contender for his party presidential nomination he actually had little hope of getting it over the popular dwight d eisenhower but in the general contest with senator robert a taft of ohio he sided with general eisenhower at a crucial moment in the convention thus accumulating a political due bill up to this point mr warren career reflected some of the same qualities he demonstrated later on the court--a capacity for the hard work a disarming affability and an ideological progression from right to left as a young prosecutor he made himself indispensable by frequently working until midnight and by mastering his and other assistants\\' cases so that as they departed for private practice it became automatic for the district attorney to turn more responsibility over to him when he became a top official himself he was a taskmaster who assumed that his subordinates would toil long hours and who rarely expressed gratitude for it smoothly toward goals with all of his ambition there was an openness about mr warren that permitted him to move smoothly toward his own goals without making those whom he might be passing--or using--feel threatened he was a big fair-haired man called pinky in his youth who loved spectator sports and outdoor life and whose suits were always double-breasted blue serge he could call hundreds of people by name but he had few close friends preferring to spend free time with his family in his early years mr warren was instinctively attracted to the kind of conservative thinking that made him a favorite of california regular republicans one february morning in 1935 he stomped grumpily into his office where a young assistant was working at a desk with open lawbooks spread around him mr warren began to slam the books shut muttering \"throw them away--forget them they\\'re no good now contracts don\\'t mean anything anymore\" he had just learned of the supreme court decision upholding the law taking the united states off the gold standard when he later ran for attorney general he favored a bill to make school children salute the flag he also proclaimed that the communist party \"should bot be entitled to legal recognition in the political life of america\" and he opposed a pardon for tom mooney the trade union radical early in his term as governor he supported the wartime federal order moving all persons of japanese ancestry from the west coast into concentration camps inland in 1943 he opposed the return of the evacuees in a governor conference speech he warned that \"if the japs are released no one will be able to tell a saboteur from any other jap\" from there he moved on to a proposal that when he made it in 1945 was so far to the left that it was denounced as socialistic it was compulsory health insurance for all citizens of california to be financed by a 3 per cent payroll tax in this he proved to be too far ahead of his time the american medical association mounted an attack against his proposal and it was rejected by the legislature mr warren opportunity for a court seat came in 1953 when chief justice fred m vinson a lackluster jurist died and president eisenhower nominated the californian there were complaints at the time that it was a political deal but it later appeared that it was not quite that pat general eisenhower said in his memoirs that he had mentioned the possibility of a supreme court seat to mr warren but that he had not considered that the first vacancy might be the chief justice seat when it occurred general eisenhower was said to have offered it first to john foster dulles who preferred to remain secretary of state next mr dewey turned it down as he wished to retire general eisenhower felt that judicial experience was needed and he considered elevating one of the associate justices but dissension within the court and the dearth of distinguished republicans there made that impracticable nevertheless general eisenhower was reported to have suggested that mr warren wait until an associate justice seat opened up mr warren reportedly replied that for him it would be chief justice or nothing on sept 30 1953 the administration let it be known that the president would give mr warren a recess appointment making him the 14th chief justice of the united states he was sworn in on oct 5 there was some criticism as mr warren began to preside over the court and the nomination did not reach congress until early the next year at the senate hearings he declined an invitation to appear even though more than 200 objections to his nomination had been filed several spokesmen for right-wing groups testified against him charges were made that he had allowed crime and corruption to flourish in california that he \"had a 100 per cent record of following the marxist line\" and that he had no experience for the job he was nonetheless confirmed by a voice vote on march 1 1954 later many warren admirers and critics termed the nomination the most momentous act of the eisenhower presidency to president eisenhower who evidently took mr warren at face value as a rather bland unexceptional individual his performance was surprising and judging by the \"damned-fool mistake\" comment apparently it was not a pleasant surprise as two figures in the traditionally fratricidal republican party mr warren and richard m nixon never enjoyed warm relations the events of the 1952 convention did most to cool them off senator nixon a delegate pledged to vote for mr warren was never quite able to conceal his own national ambitions or his preference for general eisenhower after the general won the nomination and picked mr nixon as his running mate hostility between mr warren and mr nixon was widely rumored but the destinies of the two men were not so easily severed in 1968 when mr nixon was elected president one of his most effective campaign issues was to accuse the warren court of going \"too far in weakening the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country\" after his election in mutual gestures of reconciliation mr warren administered the presidential oath to mr nixon and the president subsequently delivered a speech in the supreme court on the day mr warren retired mr nixon praised mr warren example of dignity fairness and integrity in bringing \"continuity and change\" to the law in his earlier years several incidents demonstrated that behind mr warren benign exterior was a man who was deeply sensitive to personal slights or hints of disloyalty as late as 1957 he was still sufficiently piqued at mr nixon to inform the american bar association that he would refuse an invitation to attend its convention if vice president nixon were also invited the aba chose not to invite mr nixon internal doubts or groping for consistency were rarely discernible in mr warren make-up he was a man of intense emotions which sometimes led him to judicial positions that clashed with other doctrines that he espoused speech and obscenity in his opinions on communism and political speech and association he made it clear that the values of free speech overwhelmingly outweighed the interest in \"social order\" asserted by the government but he was the kind of old-fashioned moralist who once told a man he had just met on an airplane that if a smut peddler were to sell pornography to one of his daughters he would throttle him with his bare hands so in the area of obscenity the chief justice stood out from the trend of decisions that during his tenure turned the united states from one of the most puritan to one of the most permissive nations in writing about sex it was the only issue upon which he resisted a long-term judicial movement toward greater individual liberty thus when the court majority held in 1964 that erotic material could not be suppressed by local officials unless it was objectionable under a national standard the chief justice dissented he felt that each locality should be free to ban material that violate the values of that community at the same time he was leading the court in laying down rigid police procedures that would have to be obeyed in every community in a stand similar to his position on obscenity mr warren dissented alone when the supreme court ruled in 1968 that gamblers could invoke the fifth amendment privilege against self- incrimination to avoid buying a federal tax stamp the court was applying the principle of a 1965 decision that allowed communist party members to refuse to register mr warren had joined the 1965 ruling but he saw a difference in 1968 in that gambling and not political expression was at stake the fifth amendment makes no distinction in the nature of the charge that allows a suspect to refuse to answer but mr warren aversion to gambling permitted him to find such a distinction the court \"antipolice\" image grew out of decisions limiting the kind of police activities that fell hardest upon the nonwhite poor and ignorant thus the warren majority cracked down on techniques of interrogation identification dragnet arrest and searching that were most frequently abused in the slums but police techniques most commonly used against organized crime survived the warren era virtually unscathed the majority found that the constitution would permit the use of informers police spies surveillance and court-approved wiretapping one notable exception to this pattern came in 1968 when a political backlash was building up against the court restrictions on the police and even some liberals were beginning to wonder if the court had not been too rigid in ruling out all evidence obtained in violation of the supreme court procedural rules in terry v ohio a ruling that quickly came to be known as the \"stop and frisk\" decision mr warren wrote an 8-to-1 opinion that gave the police the authority to search dangerous-looking persons \"on suspicion\" for weapons it was clear that this power might be used in a discriminatory manner against the poor and powerless but the court was faced with the fear that without it the police in urban slums faced great dangers from an armed population in an opinion that reflected the painful tensions between the rising crime problem and the court concern for minorities mr warren wrote: \"the wholesale harassment by certain elements of the police community of which minority groups particularly negroes frequently complain will not be stopped by the exclusion of any evidence from any criminal trial \"yet a rigid and unthinking application of the exclusionary rule in futile protest against practices which it can never be used effectively to control may exact a high toll in human injury and frustration of efforts to prevent crime\" he then declared with obvious reluctance that weapons seized by \"frisking\" could be used in evidence--a decision that civil libertarians lamented as a serious breach in the fourth amendment shield against unreasonable searches and seizures it was mr warren tendency to interpret the constitution in terms of the result he found desirable that drew the most criticism the result critics said was to transform the supreme court into a perpetual constitutional convention updating the constitution to square with the liberal majority concept of what the law ought to be the late justice john m harlan dissenting in the 1964 reynolds v sims case put it as follows: \"these decisions give support to a current mistaken view of the constitution and the constitutional function of this court this view in a nutshell is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional \\'principle\\' and that this court should \\'take the lead\\' in promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act the constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court ordained as a judicial body be thought of as a general haven for reform movements\" legislative role seen philip b kurland of the university of chicago law school complained that the court leaped to its conclusions without adequately explaining or justifying them \"the judicial process as demonstrated by the warren court is coming closer and closer to the legislative process\" he wrote he added the charge that \"the court has not been honest in the means that it has used to support its judgments\" mr warren admirers answered that a half-century had passed since charles evans hughes had conceded that the constitution is what the judges say it is and that the supreme court must because it is supreme \"make\" law at a time of great social upheaval sensitive issues were being placed before the court and it was argued that the justices\\' duty was to decide those issues for mr warren the outcome almost always reflected idealism fairness and equality--and the decisions made him a revered figure to many americans and people around the world one of the secrets of his success had always been that he was more effective at whatever he did than a superficial look made him appear to be this was equally true of his performance as a justice his opinions did not mark him as a great jurist as anthony lewis a critic and admirer once observed: \"a warren opinion characteristically is a world made new--a bland square presentation of the particular problem in that case almost as if it were unencumbered by precedents or conflicting theories as it inevitably must be often the framework of the argument was ethical rather than legal in the sense that one expects the law to be analytical chief justice warren opinions are difficult to analyze because they are likely to be unanalytical\" but mr warren years as a trial lawyer had made him aware of the extent to which the facts of a case reveal its real meaning in his relentless polite way he often drew out during court arguments facts that laid bare cases that had been obscured by murky constitutional principles development of an art mr warren developed the outside-the-record disclosure to a high art in his questioning of counsel he often brought out facts crucial to a decision he wanted the court to reach he would cheerfully permit the facts to be added to the record in the form of a letter or statement and the subsequent decision frequently leaned heavily upon the new information warren olney 3d an old colleague from mr warren crime-busting days in california and later chosen by mr warren to be administrator of the united states courts was his closest lifetime friend the degree of his cordiality with other justices tended to increase with ideological proximity his closest associations were with justices douglas brennan and fortas when he got away on fishing trips or to the world series or a football game it was more likely to be with the late drew pearson the columnist or ben sweig owner of the fairmont hotel in san francisco as chief justice mr warren was a far more insular figure than his successor warren e burger he severed his connections with the organized bar refused to accept awards and made few speeches his view was that the supreme court spoke solely through its opinions and he kept himself--and his law clerks and subordinates--at arms\\' length from the press in june 1968 mr warren was stunned by the assassination of robert f kennedy he later told an old friend of reading with astonishment that a few hours before the assassination people stood two and three deep along the highway into los angeles from the airport he had seen many politicians travel that route and he knew that no such assemblage had ever greeted a candidate before he took it as a sign that the nation was reaching out for younger leaders and new ideas on june 13 he wrote president johnson and tendered his resignation \"at your pleasure\" a few days later in his first public news conference as chief justice he explained that \"at the age of 77 this was a good time to retire\" he added \"i do believe we are coming into a new era as far as american life is concerned--probably so far as the entire world is concerned\" the fortas nomination mr johnson accepted effective when mr warren successor would be confirmed then he nominated mr fortas a justice closely associated with the doctrines of the warren court mr warren insisted later that this arrangement was necessary because \"there always ought to be a chief justice of the united states\" but to some others it appeared that mr warren in collusion with mr johnson was offering the court critics a hobson choice--take abe fortas as chief justice or continue to suffer earl warren in an attack that focused upon the rulings of the warren court as well as upon mr fortas a coalition of republicans and conservative democrats blocked senate action on the nomination and it was withdrawn mr warren then announced that he would retire at the end of the court term in june 1969 a final sour note was the disclosure in may that mr fortas had accepted and later returned a $20000 fee from a foundation created by the financier louis e wolfson mr warren was drawn into the matter when attorney general john n mitchell came secretly to the court and delivered documents bearing on the case it was later known that mr mitchell gave mr warren documents showing that justice fortas had been promised $20000 a year for his life and the life of his wife but it was never disclosed what mr mitchell said to

washington after his retirement he moved into a smaller office in the supreme court building and kept his apartment at the sheraton park he spent much time fishing hunting and attending football and baseball games he was greatly in demand on the banquet circuit where he accepted awards he demonstrated his political touch by telling several organizations that their award was the first he had accepted since ascending the bench supreme court justices who retire and publish usually produce weighty legal articles analyzing where the supreme court has gone or is going but mr warren wrote a book appropriate for a high school civics text it declared fidelity to the bill of rights to be the highest duty of the citizen and concluded with a homily that expressed the sweep of his hopes for american society: \"where there is injustice we should correct it; where there is poverty we should eliminate it; where there is corruption we should stamp it out; where there is violence we should punish it; where there is neglect we should provide care; where there is war we should restore peace; and wherever corrections are achieved we should add them permanently to our storehouse of

large part of the world for nearly four decades his career stamped him as one of the greatest showmen of modern times in his special field of entertainment he stood alone with a few minor exceptions he invented all his tricks and illusions and in certain instances only his four intimate helpers knew the solution in one or two very important cases houdini himself alone knew the whole secret houdini was born on march 24 1874 his name originally was eric weiss and he was the son of a rabbi he did not take the name harry houdini until he had been a performer for many years legend has it that he opened his first lock when he wanted a piece of pie in the kitchen closet it is certain that when scarcely more than a baby he showed skill as an acrobat and contortionist and both these

and trapeze performer the davenport brothers were then famous doing the first spiritualist work ever seen in this country they would ring bells while bound inside a cabinet and would agree to free themselves from any bonds this inspired houdini to a somewhat similar performance standing in the middle of the ring he would invite any one to tie him with ropes and would then free himself inside the cabinet in the ring at coffeyville kan a sheriff tied him and then produced a pair of handcuffs with the taunt: \"if i put these on you you\\'ll never get loose\" houdini still only a boy told him to go ahead after a much longer stay in the cabinet than usual the performer emerged carrying the handcuffs in his free hands that was the beginning of his long series of escapes from every known sort of manacle for years he called himself the handcuff king a title discarded as he extended and elevated the range of his performances from 1885 to 1900 he played all over the united states in museums music halls circuses and medicine shows gradually improving his technique and giving up his purely contortionistic and acrobatic feats in 1900 he made his first visit abroad and in london his

dramatic escapes including one from an air-tight galvanized vessel filled with water locked in an iron- bound chest and he would free himself from the so-called torture cell his own invention in this he was suspended head down in a tank of water to thrill the general public he would hang from the roof of a skyscraper bound in a strait-jacket from which he would wriggle free to the applause of the crowd in the street below thrown from a boat or bridge into a river bound hand and foot and locked and nailed in a box doomed to certain death by drowning or suffocation he would emerge in a minute or so a free man swimming vigorously to safety in the last twenty years houdini made many long tours playing in nearly every important city in europe asia africa and australia occasionally others would attempt to imitate him but his supremacy never was remotely threatened an evidence of the deep impression his work made on the public mind is the fact that the standard dictionary now contains a verb \"houdinize\" meaning \"to release or extricate oneself from confinement bonds or the like as by wriggling out\" a slang dictionary probably would list the expression \"do a houdini\" with a similar meaning owned valuable library during the last few years houdini had become internationally known as a tireless enemy and exposer of fraudulent mediums and all false claims in the field of spiritualism he was a member of the scientific american committee that investigated margery the boston medium whom he denounced in vigorous language he was the author of \"spooks and spiritualism\" \"the unmasking of robert houdin\" \"handcuff secrets\" and \"rope ties and escapes\" at his home 278 west 113th street he possessed a remarkable library chiefly devoted to works on the theatre to magic and the black arts the collection has been valued at $500000 and was insured for $350000 most of it has been willed to the national museum at washington in july 1926 houdini was elected for the ninth successive time president of the society of american magicians he also was president of the magicians\\' club of london and a life member of the authors\\' club of london he married in 1894 wilhelmina rahner of brooklyn he was a member of st cecile lodge no 568 f & a m bizarre experiences told by houdini tricked roosevelt on river of doubt--had four \"close-ups with death\" few men could relate more interesting anecdotes and experiences than harry houdini he was fond of telling how he beguiled the late theodore roosevelt and the late victor herbert on a voyage to europe aboard the imperator colonel roosevelt had just returned from his exploration of the river of doubt in brazil \"i was asked to give an entertainment\" houdini would relate \"and the subject of spirit writing came up a number of other well-known men were present all of them having intelligence of a high order certainly it was not a credulous audience i offered to summon the spirits and have them answer any questions that might be asked \"roosevelt wanted to know if they could tell him where he had spent christmas day i had a slate with the usual covering and in a few moments brought forth a map done in a dozen different colors of chalk which indicated the spot where he had been on the famous river of doubt that map was an exact duplicate of one that was to appear in his book which had not been published i had never seen the map and to make my case stronger the name of w t stead the english spiritualist and writer who lost his life on the titanic was signed below the map in a handwriting which one man present instantly recognized as that of stead and i might add that i was unfamiliar with stead signature colonel roosevelt dumfounded \"roosevelt was dumfounded \"\\'is it really spirit writing\\' he asked \"\\'yes\\' i replied with a wink\" of course houdini never explained how the trick was done at least to the public the magician tried his hand at the medium business in his early days in kansas and used to tell in this wise how he prepared for one of his first seances: \"i had gone around to the cemeteries and read all of the inscriptions on tombstones looked over a few birth and death records and acquired a lot of information from the gossips when the time arrived for my act i puzzled the crowd by giving particulars of births and deaths in half of the families of the town gradually i worked up to a climax exclaiming: \"\\'now what do i see what is this coming before me why it is a man--a black man he lame--and his throat is cut from ear to ear who is this man--why i know him; he is efram--efram alexander\\' the negroes at the meeting deserted in a body with shrieks because they recognized a negro who had been killed recently\" for thirty-three years houdini tried to solve the mysteries of spiritism he told friends he was ready to believe was anxious to believe because he would find joy in proof that he could communicate with his father mother and friends who had passed on he had agreed with friends and acquaintances numbering hundreds that the first to die was to try to communicate from the spirit world to the world of reality fourteen of those friends had died but none had ever given a sign he said anxious for spirit messages \"one of those pledges\" houdini once told \"was with my secretary john w sargent one of those who exposed palladino in this city our relations were most intimate he died and i have not heard from him such an agreement i made with both my parents they died and i have not heard from them i thought once i saw my mother in a vision but i now believe it was imagination \"another thing that seemed almost supernatural to me occurred at the death of william berol a mystifier and close friend of mine we had worked together on the stage and had a private telegraphic code for signaling messages we made a compact that the first who died should use that code to communicate with the other at his deathbed i held berol hand he had been unconscious for some time he showed no outward signs of a return to consciousness his eyes remained closed but just as he passed away i could feel his hand making a faint pressure upon mine that was repeated at intervals and i could recognize that the man who seemed unconscious and at death door was talking to me in code i received and understood his message but i hold it sacred and have never repeated it\" houdini counted that he had had \"four close-ups with death\" in his career of more than thirty years as a mystifier the closest was in california where he risked his life on a bet and not as a public performance seven years ago in los angeles he made a wager that he could free himself from a six-foot grave into which he was to be buried after being manacled he had first accustomed himself to the sensation of burial by more shallow interments scare nearly cost life \"the knowledge that i was six feet under the sod gave me the first thrill of horror i had ever experienced\" houdini was wont to say in telling of his hair-raising escape \"the momentary scare the irretrievable mistake of all daredevils nearly cost me my life for it caused me to waste a fraction of breath when every fraction was needed to pull through i had kept the sand loose about my body so that i could work dexterously i did but as i clawed and kneed the earth my strength began to fail then i made another mistake i yelled or at least i attempted to and the last remnants of my self-possession left me then instinct stepped in to the rescue with my last reserve strength i fought through more sand than air entering my nostrils the sunlight came like a blinding blessing and my friends about the grave said that chalky pale and wild-eyed as i was i presented a perfect imitation of a dead man rising \"the next time i am buried it will not be alive if i can help it\" but houdini did later permit himself to be \"buried alive\" in a hermetically sealed casket of zinc which was submerged in a pool at a new york hotel he remained there for more than an hour and a half bettering the record of the egyptian fakir rahmin bey when there was talk of a \"return\" submergence contest between the magician and the fakir houdini made preparations to defend his title with all the care that he was wont to exercise in working up his baffling feats he began to cancel engagements that conflicted with a period of training he mapped out for himself \"i can\\'t dine with you this afternoon at 6 o\\'clock because i have to go down at 5\" said houdini to a friend houdini went \"down\" or submerged in his sealed casket for half an hour daily friends of the showman said yesterday that he had developed a dislike for being called by his first name harry he always wished to be called houdini and disliked the prefix mr',\n",
       " 'bela bartok hungarian composer died yesterday morning at the west side hospital after a long illness at the age of 64 one of the most important composers of modern music he was also an outstanding specialist in musical folklore and a teacher of wide repute he was a leading spirit of the \"revolutionary\" generation of musicians born in the early eighties and ranked as the chief and most representative hungarian composer of his epoch bartok was born march 25 1881 at nagyszentmiklos in the hungarian district of torontal now in yugoslavia his father was director of the school of agriculture in that community and his mother a schoolteacher when his father died bartok who was 8 at the time already had begun to compose his mother gave him his first piano lessons and his progress was so rapid that at 10 he made his initial public appearance as composer-pianist from 1893 to 1899 he was in pressburg where he studied piano and composition with lazlo-erkel and janos batkai and wrote a number of unpublished works influenced by brahms in 1899 bartok entered the royal academy of music in budapest remaining there until 1903 as a pupil of janos koessler in composition and istvan thoman in piano while at the academy he came under the spell of the music of liszt wagner and richard strauss but his \"kossuth\" symphony written the year he left the school was hungarian in essence collected folk music bartok in cooperation with zoltan kodaly began collecting hungarian folk music soon after he left the academy their first joint publication \"hungarian folk songs for voice and piano\" appearing in 1906 being followed by bartok own \"twenty songs\" and \"szekely ballads\" his researches were extended to the folk music of slovakian rumanian and turkish language groups both as collector and as a serious scientific investigator in all he gathered more than 6000 folk songs of magyar slovak rumanian and transylvanian origin and later in 1913 brought back 200 arab melodies from a visit to biskra algeria the researches in the field of the indigenous music of his people not only resulted in his volume \"hungarian folk music\" the standard work on the subject but also permanently influenced his creative output in 1907 bartok was made professor of piano at the royal academy of music in budapest and in 1911 he and kodaly founded the new hungarian music society but his talents as composer were not recognized in hungary until the performance in budapest of his ballet \"the wooden prince\" and his opera \"prince bluebeard castle\" in 1917 and the premiere there of his second string quartet the next year influenced by debussy shortly after his appointment to the academy he met debussy and as a result of this contact became more radical in his compositions from then on he abandoned romanticism and became one of the first to write in the \"neo-classic\" manner simultaneously he began to use the ancient scales he discovered in hungarian folk music and in so doing found himself bringing new harmonies into existence that led to his adoption of a twelve-tone scale capable of all sorts of new harmonic combinations but he never became an atonalist bartok came to the united states for the first time in december 1927 he made his american debut dec 22 1927 with the philharmonic orchestra under willem mengelberg in carnegie hall when he was heard as soloist in his own \"rhapsodie\" op 1 instead of his first piano concerto originally scheduled the latter work received its american premiere with the composer as soloist at a concert of the cincinnati symphony under fritz reiner in the same hall in february 1928 and that same month bartok was heard with his compatriot joseph szigeti the violinist in a concert devoted largely to his own compositions presented by the pro-musica society at the gallo theatre later that year he returned to hungary appeared here with wife a concerto for violin and clarinet written in hungary by bartok for mr szigeti and benny goodman was heard for the first time with those two artists as soloists in 1939 in carnegie hall the next year bartok returned to this country and made his first appearance in washington dc at a concert in the congressional library featuring the american premiere of his \"rhapsody\" no 1 for violin and piano he participated in a program given in his honor by the league of composers at the museum of modern art april 24 1940 shortly thereafter he went to europe returning to new york in october 1940 with his wife ditta pasztory bartok with whom he was heard in the world premiere of his \"music for two pianos and percussion\" in town hall on nov 3 of that year later in the month the two artists gave a two-piano recital in the same auditorium it was also in november 1940 that columbia university conferred the degree of doctor of music upon the composer and commissioned him to transcribe the vast millman parry collection of yugoslav folk music recordings bartok was a prolific composer his stage works which suffered from unfortunate librettos but contain some of his finest music comprised the one-act opera \"prince bluebeard castle\" and two mime-ballets \"the wooden prince\" and \"the miraculous mandarin\" for orchestra he wrote two suites a \"dance suite\" two sets of \"hungarian folk songs\" \"two portraits\" \"two pictures\" and other works as well as the \"music for strings percussion and celesta\" for small orchestra his chamber music comprised six string quartets and several unpublished works he also composed a large amount of piano music and wrote a large number of songs many based on hungarian folk melodies and choral works some 450 songs from his collections were published as well as his two books from 1940 until his death bartok lived in new york he added several extensive works to his long list of compositions including a violin sonata composed last winter for yehudi menuhin and not yet played bartok made his last appearance before the public jan 21 and 22 1943 when he and his wife were the soloists in a new orchestral arrangement of the \"music for two pianos and percussion\" as a concerto according to as ember new york hungarian newspaper the american control commission in hungary recently notified the foreign minister that it had given permission to bartok to return to budapest bartok recently was elected a member of the hungarian parliament besides his widow he leaves two sons bela and peter a funeral service will be held tomorrow at 2 pm at universal chapel lexington avenue and fifty-second street burial will

       " 'new york a private funeral service to be attended by members of the family will be held for mr frost tomorrow burial will be in the family plot in old bennington vt on sunday feb 17 at 2 pm a public memorial service will be held at amherst college amherst mass the frost family suggested that instead of flowers contributions may be made to a robert frost fund to establish special chairs for high school teachers a number of such chairs have already been created in the poet name and the project was one in which he was deeply interested contributions should be sent to mr frost publisher a c edwards of holt rinehart & winston 383 madison avenue new york 17 ny remarkable in many ways robert frost was beyond doubt the only american poet to play a touching personal role at a presidential inauguration; to report a casual remark of a soviet dictator that stung officials in washington and to twit the russians about the barrier to berlin by reading to them on their own ground his celebrated poem about another kind of wall but it would be much more to the point to say he was also without question the only poet to win four pulitzer prizes and in his ninth decade to symbolize the rough-hewn individuality of the american creative spirit more than any other man finally it might have been even more appropriate to link his uniqueness to his breathtaking sense of exactitude in the use of metaphors based on direct observations \"i don\\'t like to write anything i don\\'t see\" he told an interviewer in cambridge mass two days before his 88th birthday thus he recorded timelessly by matching the sharpest observation with the most exact word how the swimming buck pushed the \"crumpled\" water; how the wagon wheels \"freshly sliced\" the april mire; how the ice crystals from the frozen birch snapped off and went \"avalanching\" on the snowy crust and to show that this phase of his gift did not blur with age there was in his last book published in 1962 by holt rinehart & winston a piece called \"pod of the milkweed\" it told of the butterflies clustered on the blossoms so avidly that \"they knocked the dyestuff off each others\\' wings\" he had seen the particular butterflies most of them monarchs just outside his \"boating\" home at ripton vt a few years before inauguration incident the incident of jan 20 1961--when john f kennedy took the oath as president--was perhaps the most dramatic of mr frost \"public\" life invited to write a poem for the occasion he rose to read it but the blur of the sun and the edge of the wind hampered him; his brief plight was so moving that a photograph of former president dwight d eisenhower mrs kennedy and mrs lyndon johnson watching him won a prize because of the deep apprehension in their faces but frost was not daunted aware of the problem he simply put aside the new poem and recited from memory an old favorite \"the gift outright\" dating to the nineteen-thirties it fit the circumstances as snugly as a glove later he took the unread \"new\" poem which had been called \"the preface\" expanded it from 42 to 77 lines retitled it \"for john f kennedy: his inaugural\"--and presented it to the president in march 1962 later that year mr frost accompanied stewart l udall secretary of the interior on a visit to moscow a first encounter with soviet children studying english did not encourage the poet he recognized the problem posed by the language; it was painfully ironic because he had said years before that poetry was what was \"lost in translation\" and in moscow his first hearers clearly did not understand well in english but a few days later he read \"mending wall\" at a moscow literary evening \"something there is that doesn\\'t love a wall\" the poem begins the russians may not have got the subsequent nuances but the idea quickly spread that the choice of the poem was not unrelated to the wall partitioning berlin on sept 7 the poet had a long talk with premier khrushchev he described the soviet leader as \"no fathead\"; as smart big and \"not a coward\" \"he not afraid of us and we\\'re not afraid of him\" he added subsequently frost reported that mr khrushchev had said the united states was \"too liberal to fight\" it was this remark that caused a considerable stir in washington thus in the late years of his life frost moved among the mighty he was a public personage to thousands of persons who had never read his works but to countless others loyal and loving to the point of idolatry he remained not only a poet but the poet of his day during the first years of the kennedy administration frost was unquestionably a kind of celebrity- poet around washington his face was seen smiling in the background--and frequently the foreground--of news photographs from the capitol and quite often he appeared in public with democratic politicians president kennedy when asked why he had requested that frost speak at the inauguration praised the \"courage the towering skill and daring\" of his fellow new englander among the many things that both shared was the high esteem of a poet place in american society \"there is a story that some years ago an interested mother wrote to a principal of a school \\'don\\'t teach my boy poetry he going to run for congress\\'\" president kennedy said \"i\\'ve never taken the view that the world of politics and the world of poetry are so far apart i think politicians and poets share at least one thing and that is their greatness depends upon the courage with which they face the challenges of life\" echoes the poet cry he was echoing a cry that frost had long made--the higher role of the poet in business society in fact in 1960 mr frost had urged congress to declare poets the equal of big business and received a standing ovation from spectators when he supported a bill to create a national academy of culture \"i have long thought of something like this\" mr frost told a senate education subcommittee \"everyone comes down to washington to get equal with someone else i want our poets to be declared equal to--what shall i say--the scientists no to big business\" many years before but several years after he had achieved recognition for his work frost had slouched characteristically before an audience of young writers gathered under bread loaf mountains at middlebury vt he said: \"every artist must have two fears--the fear of god and the fear of man--fear of god that his creation will ultimately be found unworthy and the fear of man that he will be misunderstood by his fellows\" these two fears were ever present in robert frost with the result that his published verses were of the highest order and completely understood by thousands of americans in whom they struck a ready response to countless persons who had never seen new hampshire birches in the snow or caressed a perfect ax he exemplified a great american tradition with his superb almost angular verses written out of the new england scene not since whittier in \"snowbound\" had captured the penetrating chill of new england brief december day had any american poet more exactly caught the atmosphere north of boston or the thin philosophy of its fence-mending inhabitants his pictures of an abandoned cord of wood warming \"the frozen swamp as best it could with the slow smokeless burning of decay\" or of how \"two roads diverged in a wood and i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference\" with their yankee economy of words moved his readers nostalgically and filled the back pastures of their mind with memories of a shrewd and quiet way of life 20 years of rejection strangely enough frost spent 20 years writing his verses on stone walls and brown earth blue butterflies and tall slim trees without winning any recognition in america when he sent them to the atlantic monthly they were returned with this note: \"we regret that the atlantic has no place for your vigorous verse\" it was not until \"a boy will\" was published in england and ezra pound publicized it that robert frost was recognized as the indigenous american poet that he was after that the way was not so hard and in the years that followed he was to win the pulitzer prize four times be honored by many institutions of higher learning and find it possible for a poet who would write of things that were \"common in experience uncommon in writing\" to earn enough money so that he would not have to teach or farm or make shoes or write for newspapers--all things he had done in his early days raymond holden poet and critic pointed out in a \"profile\" in the new yorker magazine that there was more than the ordinary amount of paradox in the personality and career of frost essentially a new england poet in a day when there were few poets in that region he was born in san francisco; fundamentally a yankee he was the son of an ardent democrat whose belief in the confederacy led him to name his son robert lee; a farmer in new hampshire he preferred to sit on a fence and watch others work; a teacher he despised the rigors of the educational process as practiced in the institutions where he taught like many another yankee individualist robert frost was a rebel so was his father william frost who had run away from amherst mass to go west his mother born in edinburgh scotland emigrated to philadelphia when she was a girl his father died when robert who was born march 26 1874 was about 11 the boy and his mother the former isabelle moody went to live at lawrence mass with william prescott frost robert grandfather who gave the boy a good schooling influenced by the poems of edgar allan poe robert wanted to be a poet before he went to dartmouth college where he stayed only through the year 1892 in the next several years he worked as a bobbin boy in the lawrence mills was a shoemaker and for a short while a reporter for the lawrence sentinel he attended harvard in 1897-98 then became a farmer at derry nh and taught there in 1905 he married elinor white also a teacher by whom he had five children in 1912 mr frost sold the farm and the family went to england he came home to find the editor of the atlantic monthly asking for poems he sent along the very ones that had previously been rejected and they were published the frosts went to franconia nh to live in a farm house mr frost had bought for $1000 his poetry brought him some money and in 1916 he again became a teacher he was a professor of english then \"poet in residence\" for more than 20 years at amherst college and he spent two years in a similar capacity at the university of michigan later frost lectured and taught at the new school in new york in 1938 he retired temporarily as a teacher mrs frost died that year in florida afterward he taught intermittently at harvard amherst and dartmouth won many honors in 1916 frost who had then been a poet for 20 years was made a member of the national institute of arts and letters; in 1930 of the american academy his books \"new hampshire: a poem with notes and gracenotes\" won him the pulitzer prize in 1924 when his \"corrected poems\" were published in 1931 he again won that prize the pulitzer committee honored him a third time in 1937 for his book \"a further range\" and again in 1943 for \"a witness tree\" frost won many honorary degrees from master of arts at amherst in 1917 to doctor of humane letters at the university of vermont in 1923 and others followed from harvard yale and other institutions the issuing in 1949 of \"the complete poems of robert frost\" a 642-page volume was the signal for another series of broad critical appraisals studded with phrases like \"lasting significance\" the limited editions club awarded frost its gold medal and in the following october poets scholars and editors gathered to do him honor at the kenyon college conference in washington the senate adopted a resolution to send him greetings on his 75th birthday on that occasion he said that 20 acres of land for every man \"would be the answer to all the world problems\" noting that life on the farm would show men \"their burdens as well as their privileges\" the only existing copy of frost first book \"twilight and other poems\" was auctioned here that december for $3000 a price thought to be the highest paid for a work by a contemporary american author \"it had no success and deserved none\" the poet commented in later years frost who once wrote: i bid you to a one-man revolution--the only revolution that is coming became interested in politics and some of his later verses were on this theme his lectures at harvard where he was charles eliot norton lecturer in 1936 and 1939 and elsewhere were less about poetry and more about the moral values of life but it was less to these than to his earlier works that readers turned for satisfaction; to such lines as these on the \"hired man\": nothing to look backward to with pride nothing to look forward to with hope    while critics heaped belated praise on his earthy yankee birchbark-clear poems there were also finely fashioned lyrics in which the man of the soil flashed fire with intellect such a poem was \"reluctance\" with its nostalgic ending: ah when to the heart of man was it ever less than treason to go with the drift of things to yield with a grace to reason and bow and accept the end of a love or a season or: some say the world will end in fire some say in ice from what i\\'ve tasted of desire i hold with those who favor fire but if i had to perish twice i think i know enough of hate to say that for destruction ice is also great and would suffice even critics who found a harshness sometimes in his work credited mr frost with being a great poet they appreciated his philosophy of simplicity perhaps more in later years than during the \"renaissance\" of american poetry in the nineteen-twenties for they knew it was a part of robert frost whose innate philosophy of unchangeableness he once expressed when he wrote: they would not find me changed from him they knew only more sure of all i thought was true     at an annual joint ceremonial in may 1950 of the american academy and the national institute he read a poem entitled \"how hard it is to keep from being king when it in you and in the situation\" asked about his method of writing a poem frost said: \"i have worried quite a number of them into existence but any sneaking preference [i have had] remains for the ones i have carried through like the stroke of a racquet club or headsman ax\" in an interview with harvey breit of the new york times book review he observed: \"if poetry isn\\'t understanding all the whole word then it isn\\'t worth anything young poets forget that poetry must include the mind as well as the emotions too many poets delude themselves by thinking the mind is dangerous and must be left out well the mind is dangerous and must be left in\"',\n",
       " 'chicago aug 18--mies van der rohe one of the great figures of 20th-century architecture died in wesley memorial hospital here late last night he was 83 years old mr van der rohe had entered the hospital two weeks ago he is survived by two daughters mrs georgia van der rohe and mrs marianne lohan; five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren expressed industrial spirit ludwig mies van der rohe a man without any academic architectural training was one of the great artist-architect-philosophers of his age acclaimed as a genius for his uncompromisingly spare design his fastidiousness and his innovations along with frank lloyd wright and le corbusier the german-born master builder who was universally know as mies pronounced mees fashioned scores of imposing structures expressing the spirit of the industrial 20th century \"architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space\" he remarked in a talkative moment pressed to explain his own role as a model for others--a matter on which he was shy as he was on most others--he said: \"i have tried to make an architecture for a technological society i have wanted to keep everything reasonable and clear--to have an architecture that anybody can do\" a building he was convinced should be \"a clear and true statement of its times\"--cathedrals for an age of pathos glass and metal cages for an age of advanced industrialism he thought the george washington bridge in new york an outstanding example of a structure expressing its period and he used to go to admire it whenever he visited the city \"it is the most modern building in the city\" he remarked in 1963 he was fond of the bridge because he considered it beautifully proportioned and because it did not conceal its structure mies liked to see the steel the brick the concrete of buildings show themselves rather than be concealed by ornamentation a 20th-centrury industry building had to be pithy he believed influence on colleagues mies stature rested not only on his lean yet sensuous business and residential buildings but also on the profound influence he exerted on his colleagues and on public taste as the number of his structures multiplied in the years since world war ii and as their stunning individuality became apparent critical appreciation flowed to him in torrents and his designs and models drew throngs to museums where they were exhibited it became a status symbol to live in a mies house to work in a mies building or even to visit one the mies name had already been established among architects long before he came to the united states in 1937 in 1919 and 1921 in berlin he designed two steel skyscrapers sheathed in glass from street to roof although the buildings were never erected the designs are now accepted as the originals of today glass-and-metal skyscrapers ribbon windows in 1922 mies introduced the concept of ribbon windows uninterrupted bands of glass between the finished faces of concrete slabs in a design for a german office building that has since become the basis for many commercial structures mies in 1924 produced plans for a concrete villa that is now regarded as the forerunner of the california ranch house he is also said to have foreshadowed the return of the inner patio of roman times in an exhibition house built in 1931; to have started the idea of space dividers the use of cabinets or screens instead of walls to break up interiors; and to have originated the glass house with windows and glass sliding panels extending from floor to ceiling to permit outside greenery to form the visual boundaries of a room apart from simplicity of form what struck students of mies buildings was their painstaking craftsmanship their attention to detail \"god is in the details\" mies liked to say in this respect the buildings reflected the man for mies was fussy about himself a large lusty man with a massive head topping a 5-foot 10-inch frame he dressed in exquisitely hand-stitched suits of conservative hue dined extravagantly well on haute cuisine sipped the correct wines from the proper goblets and chained-smoked hand-rolled cigars gold chain for watch for a man so modern in his conceptions he had more than a touch of old-fashionedness it showed up in such things as the gold chain across his waistcoat to which was attached his pocket timepiece rather than live in a contemporary building or one of his own houses--he briefly contemplated moving to a mies apartment but feared fellow tenants might badger him--he made his home in a high-ceilinged five-room suite on the third floor of an old-fashioned apartment house on chicago north side the thick-walled rooms were large and they included predictably a full kitchen with an ancient gas range for his cook the apartment contained armless chairs and furniture of his own designs as well as sofas and wing chairs--in which he preferred to sit the walls were stark white; but the apartment had a glowing warmth given off by the klees braques and schwitterses that dotted its walls paul klee was a close friend and mies collection of klees was among the finest in private hands mies chairs were almost as well known as his buildings and they were just as spare he designed his first chair known as the mr chair in 1926 it had a caned seat and back and its frame was tubular steel there followed the barcelona chair an elegant armless leather and steel design of which the legs formed an x; the tugendhat chair an armless affair of leather and steel that resembled a square s; and the brno chair with a steel frame and leather upholstery that looked like a curved s the bottoms of all these chairs were uniformly wide a circumstance that puzzled furniture experts until one of them asked mies for an explanation it was simple he said; he had designed them with his own comfort in mind recognition after 50 mies did not receive wide public recognition in the united states until he was over 50 years old up to 1937 he lived in germany where he was born at aachen on march 27 1886 emigrating to chicago he had to wait for the postwar building boom before many of his designs were translated into actuality at his death examples of his work were in chicago pittsburgh des moines baltimore detroit newark new york houston washington sao paulo mexico city montreal toronto and berlin all his buildings were dissimilar although the same basic principles were employed in each the principles centered in a gothic demand for order logic and clarity \"the long path through function to creative work has only a single goal\" he said \"to create order out of the desperate confusion of our time\" one mies structure accounted among his outstanding ones is the 38-story dark bronze and pinkish-gray glass seagram building on park avenue between 52d and 53d streets the building which was designed in association with philip c johnson has been called by appreciative critics the city most tranquil tower and \"the most beautiful curtain-wall building in america\" it emphasizes pure line fine materials and exact detailing outside and in special attention was paid to the room numbers doorknobs elevator buttons bathroom fixtures and mail chutes as well as the furniture the building grace is enhanced by its being set in a half-acre fountained plaza of pink granite it was begun in 1956 and completed two years later at a cost of $35-million it was at the time the city most costly office building not everyone who gazed upon it or watched its extruded bronze aging was convinced of its beauty acerbic nonarchitectural critics pointed out that the tower rises 520 feet without setbacks and that it is unornamented it is too spare they said one likened it to an upended glass coffin the seagram building ranked third in mies offhand list of his six favorites chosen to illustrate his most notable concept--\"less is more\" by this delphic utterance he meant achieving the maximum effect with the minimum of means first on the list was the illinois institute of technology crown hall this is a single glass- walled room measuring 120 feet by 220 feet and spanned by four huge trusses the structure appears to do no more than to enclose space a feeling reinforced by its interior movable partitions it was one of 20 buildings that mies designed for the school 100-acre campus on chicago south side crown hall is as good an example as any of mies \"skin-and-bones architecture\" a phrase that he once used to describe his point of view the chicago federal center mies largest complex of high- and low-rise buildings was his second favorite he considered its symmetry symbolic of his lifelong battle against disorder another chicago creation was fourth--two 26-story apartment house towers at 860 and 880 lake shore drive that overlook lake michigan the facades are all glass tenants had to accept the neutral gray curtains that were uniform throughout the buildings and that provided the only means of seeking privacy and excluding light no other curtains or blinds were permitted lest they mar the external appearance he was also the architect of the promontory apartments in chicago in which he used brick and glass in an exposed concrete frame mies fifth favorite was a project for a chicago convention hall a place for 50000 people to gather in unobstructed space under a trussed roof 720 feet square the project never materialized the final pet on the architect list was the since-destroyed german pavilion at the 1929 international exposition at barcelona it was one critic said \"a jewel-case structure employing the open planning first developed by frank lloyd wright that combined the richness of bronze chrome steel and glass with free-standing walls\" in addition to the seagram building the architect was represented in the new york area by the pavilion and colonnade apartments both in colonnade park newark he also devised a master plan for a 21-acre development in new haven mies most recent building the national gallery in berlin opened last september it is a templelike glass box set on top of a larger semibasement and serves as a museum although many accolades were bestowed on mies for these and other works there were also brickbats \"unsparing\" \"grim\" the work of \"barren intellectualism\" and \"brutal in its destruction of individual possessions and the individual\" were some of the terms his detractors used \"less is less\" they said turning his aphorism against him taught by mason father ludwig mies who added the \"van der rohe\" from his mother name because of its sonority learned the elements of architecture from his father a german master mason and stonecutter and from studying the medieval churches in aachen at times friends recalled he would describe with unrestrained enthusiasm the quality of brick and stone its texture pattern and color \"now a brick that really something\" he once said \"that really building not paper architecture\" for him the material was always the beginning he used to talk of primitive building methods where he saw the \"wisdom of whole generations\" stored in every stroke of an ax every bite of a chisel his students in the united states and germany had to learn the fundamentals of building before they could start to consider questions of design he taught them how to build first with wood then stone then brick and finally with concrete and steel \"new materials are not necessarily superior\" he would say \"each material is only what we make it\" at aachen mies attended trade school and became a draftsman apprentice before setting off for berlin at the age of 19 to become an apprentice to bruno paul germany leading furniture designer two years later he built his first house a wooden structure on a sloping site in suburban berlin its style was 18th century in 1909 mies apprenticed himself to peter behrens then the foremost progressive architect in germany who had taught le corbusier and walter gropius mies was put in charge of behrens german embassy in st petersburg russia house never built going to the netherlands in 1912 mies designed a house for mrs h e l j kroller owner of the renowned kroller muller collection of modern paintings near the hague he set up a full- scale canvas and wood mock-up on the site to assure perfection but the house was never built mies returned to berlin in 1913 and opened his own office but with the outbreak of the war in 1914 his life was dislocated for four years in the german army during which he built bridges and roads in the balkans after the war with his own style coming into definition he directed the architectural activities of the novembergruppe an organization formed to propagandize modern art and became one of the few progressive architects of the time to employ brick often he would go to the kilns to select one by one the bricks he wanted he used them for the monument now destroyed to karl liebknecht and rosa luxemburg the german communist leaders; for suburban villas for wealthy businessmen; and for low-cost housing for the city of berlin from 1926 to 1932 he was first vice president of the deutscher werkbund formed to integrate art and industry in design he directed the group second exposition the weissenhof housing project erected in stuttgart in 1927 the peak achievements of mies european career were the german barcelona pavilion and the tugendhat house in 1930 a james speyer a critic for art news extolled them both as \"among the most important buildings of contemporary architecture and the most beautiful of our generation\" the pavilion consisted of a rectangular slab roof supported by steel columns beneath which free-standing planes of roman travertine marble onyx and glass of various hues were placed to create the feeling of space beyond the tugendhat house permitted space to flow in a similar fashion in 1930 mies took over direction of the bauhaus a laboratory of architecture and design in dessau germany it was closed three years later after the nazis attacked the architect as \"degenerate\" and \"un-german\" at the urging of a new york architect who was a close friend philip c johnson mies emigrated to the united states to head the school of architecture at the armour now illinois institute of technology in chicago he retired from the post in 1958 as a teacher mies did not deliver formal lectures but worked seminar fashion with groups of 10 or 12 students his method of teaching according to a former student was \"almost tacit\" \"he was never wildly physically active and he did not do much talking\" this student recalled adding that mies sitting buddha-like would frequently puff through a whole cigar before commenting on a student sketch abandoning the beaux arts system based on competition for prizes mies sternly told his students: \"first you have to learn something; then you can go out and do it\" he was not one to tolerate self-expression among his students one of them once asked him about it silently he handed the student a pencil and paper then he told her to write her name this done he said: \"that for self-expression now we get to work\" another former student thought of mies as \"a great teacher because he subjects himself to an extraordinary discipline in thinking and in his way of working and because what he is teaching is very clear to him\" mies himself was quite confident of his influence \"i don\\'t know how many students we have had\" he said a couple of years ago \"but you need only 10 to change the cultural climate if they are good\" mies was well-to-do but not wealthy he received the usual architect fee of 6 per cent of the gross cost of a building but he was not a very careful manager of his income according to his friends he was considered generous with his office staff and on spending for designs that were unlikely to see the light of day the architect received three noteworthy honors--the presidential freedom medal and the gold medals of the royal institute of british architects and of the american institute of architects he was a member of the national institute of arts and letters',\n",

       " 'london sept 18--sean o\\'casey the irish playwright died tonight of a heart attack in torquay he was 84 years old he had lived in the resort town on the southwest coast of england for many years the dramatist long an exile from his native ireland died at about 7 pm shortly after he was taken to a nursing home his body will be cremated and details of funeral arrangements will be announced tomorrow from the bitterness of poverty and from the love of humanity sean o\\'casey created works of drama and prose-poetry that sang of freedom exuberance and reviled spiritual penury from earliest days in the drab streets and two-story brick boxes of dublin slums until his aging years of self-driven british exile amid the red earth and salt air of torquay this gaunt fiery writer never abandoned his faith in the dignity of man for his cause he spurned neither fight or embrace but like the tumultuous passionate sentences that swirled and plunged through his plays essays letters and autobiographical works he was more concerned with poetry than logic; more with shoulder-heaving laughter than with back-bending research even in his 80 looking very much the poor country vicar with his worn tweed jacket pipe white hair ascetic face and steel-rimmed glasses mr o\\'casey continued to call out as hotly as ever to young writers not to be \"afraid of life full-throated shouting afraid of its venom suspicious of its gentleness its valor its pain and its rowdiness\" by then the man whose plays had touched off riots whose diatribes had nettled churchmen and atheists was nearly blind still he sought out the restless vigor of the young and enjoyed the laughter and rows of pub and street \"the artist life\" he advised \"is to be where life is active life found in neither ivory tower nor concrete shelter; he must be out listening to everything looking at everything and thinking it all out afterward\" there were many even among his most ardent admirers who consistently questioned the infallibility of the o\\'casey gift for reason they would chide him for instance for his continued support of the soviet union pointing out that his passion for personal liberty was irreconcilable with the tyranny of the kremlin stubbornly though he clung to his belief dismissing derogatory information as propaganda actually he was quite hazy about political ideologies once for example in the early 1950 he told an american visitor that there were \"many millions of communists in the united states\" he explained that president franklin delano roosevelt and all who voted for him were communists a communist said the writer \"is anyone who tries to help humanity\" sharp characterization but even those who quarreled with what mr o\\'casey wrote did not doubt the beauty of his prose thus though his internationally famous plays--\"the shadow of a gunman\" \"the plough and the stars\" \"juno and the paycock\" and \"within the gates\"--stirred up storms among spectators and critics they were read long afterward by many thousands throughout the english-speaking world for their magnificent lines their sharp characterization and their robust humor critics sometimes quibbled about the form of mr o\\'casey works particularly the symbolism of such plays as \"within the gates\" \"cock-a-doodle dandy\" and \"purple dust\" but they were overwhelmed by the eloquence imagery and fire of mr o\\'casey writings particularly in his six autobiographical books that emerged from 1939 to 1955 under the titles of \"i knock at the door\" \"pictures in the hallway\" \"drums under the window\" \"inishfallen fare thee well\" \"rose and crown\" and \"sunset and evening star\" one critic called the o\\'casey style \"a great and lovely tide of rhetoric\" mr o\\'casey said his works and arguments had made him \"tattered and torn like a man tossed by the cow with the crumpled horn but still sparing for defense and a forward blow\" some who had never felt the searing insult of mr o\\'casey anger talked warmly of his gentleness of the soft lyric brogue that made him on broadway or the west end always a part of dublin o\\'connell street his friends roared as he would recall the pranks of childhood or describe a weekend at lady astor \"feeding off solid silver and sleeping in a room like a stadium\" but for those mr o\\'casey disliked he showed another side of one man for instance he wrote: \"he was a pathetic figure when he talked to one speckled one cheeks with spittle a prying index finger every moment prodding behind a collar a size too large for his neck seeking something disturbing the upper part of his back; forever adding a spate of useless words to his monstrous diary given at last to the national library when it should have been given to the fire\" attacked catholic church mr o\\'casey not only took on individuals but also groups in his verbal brawls he called atheists \"those who trying to get rid of god plant him more firmly on his throne\" and evangelists he said were \"those preachers who daub the glories of god with mockeries\" though he was fairly general in his resentment of organized religion he singled out the roman catholic church for special attacks the importance of his target was just another challenge he accused george russell \"ae\" one of the most influential irish journalists of \"hopabout runaway intellectual agitation; a congested mass of nonsense is your nut\" though he almost lost his life in the struggle for irish freedom mr o\\'casey said of the first irish president eamon de valera: \"there seemed to be no sound of irish wind water folkchant or birdsong in the dry dull voice\" he was particularly savage in assaulting literary ideas he found offensive thus in the early 1930 when realistic approaches to drama found general favor he wrote: \"the beauty fire and poetry of drama have perished in a storm of fake realisms let real birds fly through the air; real animals roam through the jungle real fish swim in the sea but let us have art in the theater there is a deeper life than the life we see and hear with the open ear and the open eye and this is the life important and the life everlasting so to hell with so-called realism for it leads nowhere\" mr o\\'casey hard path began almost at his birth in dublin on march 30 1880 when he was a child his father died his eyes were bad and his teachers by his accounts had a strong sense of sadism his brother and sister died when still young at the age of 14 he went to work as a laborer humiliated by poverty a protestant rebel in a catholic city his great solace was literature he would steal books his love for shakespeare was one of the forces that drove him to write for the theater between 12-hour days at manual labor and nights of plotting irish rebellion mr o\\'casey sampled a good deal of the hunger anguish and ferocity of the poor of dublin at one point when a charity patient in a hospital his most vivid memory was that the food was so much better than his usual repasts after some strong tastes of amateur theatricals the young man decided that writing was the way to express what he had seen heard and thought of the world the abbey theater after turning down a few plays accepted \"the shadow of a gunman\" in 1925 there was some resentment in the audience toward the play even more toward \"juno and the paycock\" and when \"the plough and the stars\" opened there in 1926 a riot broke out but amid demonstrations and uproar the play though interrupted was finished with what one correspondent described as the \"greatest ovation\" at that theater driven from ireland by that time however the o\\'casey penchant for argument had driven him not only from the abbey theater but also from ireland the board of the theater had refused to do his \"the silver tassle\" in his fury the author berated even w b yeats a member of the board and a man he greatly respected mr o\\'casey never returned to ireland though he often became homesick london however lionized the playwright and even tolerated his foibles he refused for example to wear a dinner jacket preferring his turtle-neck sweater a dinner jacket he said was fit only for the coffin he wore the sweater even for his church wedding in london in 1927 to eileen reynolds she was an irish actress who used the name carey they had two sons and a daughter mr o\\'casey despite his enormous reputation earned very little money either from his plays or his books an o\\'casey revival in 1956 something of an o\\'casey revival began in new york paul shyre a young actor and writer wrote and produced adaptations of the o\\'casey autobiographies and lesser-known plays his \"i knock at the door\" done in readings on a bare stage was a hit both on and off broadway in 1956 and 1957 he achieved a similar success with \"pictures in the hallway\" in 1956 \"purple dust\" ran for 480 performances during 1957 at the cherry lane theater in greenwich village \"red roses for me\" in january 1956 was a sell-out a musical version of \"juno and the paycock\" written by marc blitzstein was prepared during 1958 mr o\\'casey \"drums of father ned\" was one of the plays selected by the dublin theater festival for the summer of 1958 but it was withdrawn in may so was a dramatization of james joyce \"ulysses\" as well as a play by samuel beckett the roman catholic archbishopric in dublin disapproved of all these and some other selections mr o\\'casey reaction was typical of him he banned all his plays from production in any part of the irish republic the ban was in effect the rest of his life though he did lift it on occasion mr o\\'casey explained his feelings behind the ban in an article in the new york times last jan 5 he wrote: \"i have lived a troublesome life in ireland in my youth hard times in the body and in my manhood years a hard time in the spirit hardship in my young days taught me how to fight hard for if that characteristic wasn\\'t developed then it meant that one became either a slave or a lick-spittle \"so i learned how to resist all aggressive attempts to make me a docile one and could hit back as hard as he who could hit hardest this gift for an earned gift it is kept within me when i reached the world of thought as it had been in the world of hard labor--at times i fear fighting what i thought to be aggression where none was meant \"indeed had i been adam i think i should have resisted the angel with his sword of flaming fire that drove him and his eve from the garden of eden\" extended the ban last month mr o\\'casey extended the ban to the irish pavilion at the world fair which had requested his permission to play recorded excerpts from his works despite failing eyesight mr o\\'casey continued to write until his death essays poured out of his portable typewriter from his third-floor flat in torquay \"the worst of it\" he said in an interview last month \"is that i can\\'t see the mistakes i type\" to ward off drafts in his later years mr o\\'casey took to wearing colored skull caps they became as much a part of his costume as the familiar turtleneck sweater the title of his last book of essays published in 1963 was \"under a colored cap\" mr o\\'casey died while metro-goldwyn-mayer was filming \"young cassidy\" a movie based on his autobiography in a sense he wrote his own epitaph in the last of his autobiographical books which he wrote in the third person \"here\" he wrote \"with whitened hair desires failingstrength ebbing out of him with the sun gone down and with only the serenity and calm warning of the evening star left to him he drank to life to all it had been to what it was to what it would be hurrah!\"',\n",
       " 'cesar chavez the migrant worker who emerged from the poverty of an agricultural valley in arizona to found america first successful union of farm workers was found dead yesterday in san luis ariz he was 66 mr chavez who lived in keene calif and was in arizona on union business died in his sleep the local police said an autopsy is planned blending the nonviolent resistance of gandhi with the organizational skills of his mentor the social activist saul alinsky mr chavez captured worldwide attention in the 1960 leading an initially lonely battle to unionize the fields and orchards of california he issued a call to boycott grapes that soon became a cause celebre mr chavez who was described by robert f kennedy in 1968 as \"one of the heroic figures of our time\" was widely acknowledged to have done more to improve the lot of the migrant farm worker than anyone else fighting growers and shippers who for generations had defeated efforts to unionize field workers and later fighting rival unionists mr chavez for the first time brought a degree of stability and security to the lives of some migrant workers largely because of him the california legislature in 1975 passed the nation first collective bargaining act outside hawaii for farm workers who are largely excluded from federal labor law coverage \"for the first time\" mr chavez said when asked to describe the union achievement \"the farm worker got some power\" asked what had motivated his stubborn fight he said \"for many years i was a farm worker a migratory worker and well personally -- and i\\'m being very frank -- maybe it just a matter of trying to even the score\" but he ultimately failed to realize his dream of forging a nationwide organization in most of america farm workers continue to toil for low wages without job security vulnerable to exploitation even in california he found it difficult to translate the early triumphs of what he called la causa into a viable labor organization the union that mr chavez founded the united farm workers of america became troubled by dissent and other problems and was unable to organize more than 20 percent of california 200000 farm workers the tactics that he used so effectively in the 1960 and early 70 -- strikes and boycotts fasting and the long march -- eventually lost their magic and as the united farm workers were no longer seen as a social cause but as a conventional labor union he was disappointed by the disaffection of politicians and other supporters gains from unionization in 1965 when he formed the union farm workers in california averaged less than $150 an hour they had no fringe benefits no seniority rights and no standing to challenge abuses by employers or exploitative labor contractors unionization brought sharp pay increases for the first time migrant workers were eligible for medical insurance employer-paid pensions unemployment insurance and other benefits and they had a mechanism to challenge employer abuses and the union impact extended far beyond its membership the threat of unionization by mr chavez raised agricultural wages throughout california born on arizona farm cesar estrada chavez was born on march 31 1927 near yuma ariz the second of five children of juana and librado chavez his father parents migrated from mexico in 1880 his early years were spent on the family 160-acre farm but in the seventh year of the depression when he was 10 the family fell behind on mortgage payments and lost its farm along with thousands of other families in the southwest they sought a new life in california they found it picking carrots cotton and other crops in arid valleys following the sun in search of the next harvest and the next migrants\\' camp mr chavez never graduated from high school and once counted 65 elementary schools he had attended \"for a day a week or a few months\" beginning with the industrial workers of the world at the turn of the century unions tried for decades to organize immigrant unskilled workers first chinese then japanese and later filipinos and mexican-americans on whom california growers depended but the field hands their organizing drives vulnerable to the competition of other poor migrants seeking work found themselves fighting not only powerful growers but also the police and government officials in 1939 mr chavez family settled in san jose his father became active in a successful effort to organize workers at a dried-fruit packing plant giving mr chavez his first glimpse of workers taking collective action after world war ii in which he served two years in the navy mr chavez resumed his life as a migrant he married helen fabela in delano which he later made famous far beyond its dusty corner of the san joaquin valley besides his wife he is survived by eight children 27 grandchildren a great-grandchild three brothers and two sisters the pivotal role in mr chavez emergence as a labor leader was played by mr alinsky the chicago-based organizer who described himself as a \"professional radical\" in the early 1950 he helped mexican-americans organize into a political bloc mr alinsky sent an aide to recruit potential leaders and among the first people he met was mr chavez then working in a san jose apricot orchard mr chavez joined mr alinsky community service organization registering mexican-americans to vote and helping them deal with government agencies but he later criticized the organization as dominated by non-hispanic liberals and in 1958 he quit went to delano and formed the national farm workers association five years of la huelga by 1965 mr chavez had organized 1700 families and persuaded two growers to raise wages moderately his fledging union was too weak for a major strike but 800 workers in a virtually moribund afl-cio group the agricultural workers organizing committee struck grape growers in delano and some of the members of his group demanded to join the strike that was the beginning of five years of la huelga -- \"the strike\" -- in which the frail labor leader who was 5 feet 6 inches tall became familiar to people in much of the world as he battled the economic power of the farmers and corporations in the san joaquin valley with its charismatic leader song-filled meetings and the fundamental appeal of its struggle depicted as a downtrodden minority battling an exploitative oligopoly mr chavez organization reminded many old-timers of the industrial battles that they had waged generations earlier he was shy and not an outstanding public speaker but he showed a humility that with his shyness and small stature piercing dark eyes and facial features that hinted at indian ancestors gave him an image as a david taking on the goliaths of agriculture mr chavez style was monastic almost religious he said his life was dedicated only to bettering the lives of the exploited farm workers he was a vegetarian and his weekly salary of $5 was a virtual vow of poverty articles about him often spoke of his \"saintly\" and even \"messianic\" qualities soon priests and nuns college students and unionists from around the country marched with mr chavez supporters sent money for la causa most of the farm workers who enlisted had meager resources and were asked to pay only the dues they could afford often only a few cents a month borrowing from gandhi mr chavez sometimes went on fasts or invited arrest to call attention to his battle with the growers but he ran the union along authoritarian lines with music and singing and hundreds of fluttering flags bearing the union symbol of a black eagle on a field of red union rallies had the quality of ritual typically mr chavez arrived late at the rallies appearing to a roar of approval after a musical group had played and other speakers warmed up the audience in 1968 he began his most visible campaign urging americans not to buy table grapes produced in the san joaquin valley until growers agreed to union contracts the boycott proved a huge success a public opinion poll found that 17 million americans had stopped buying grapes because of the boycott on july 30 1970 after losing millions of dollars growers agreed to sign it was probably the high point in the union history more successful boycotts and organizing successes followed but soon many of the largest growers in an effort to stave off mr chavez union invited the international brotherhood of teamsters to organize their workers mr chavez complained that the teamsters were signing \"sweetheart contracts\" and before long his hard-won gains in delano seemed to be slipping away more growers many charging that the united farm workers was poorly run and undependable signed with the teamsters but two things kept his dream alive: first the teamsters\\' leaders smarting from charges of corruption made a truce second edmund g brown jr a democrat who had marched with the farm workers before his election as governor in 1974 won adoption of the state agricultural labor relations act a landmark bill establishing collective bargaining for farm workers and granting the union concessions among these concessions was a \"good standing clause\" which in effect permitted union leaders to deny work in the fields to any worker who challenged their decisions the teamsters virtually abandoned the fight against mr chavez in 1977 in the years that followed the united farm workers signed occasional contracts with growers but never attained the dominance that mr chavez envisioned a decade after the delano strike fewer than 10 percent of the grapes in that community were harvested by his union members in the mid-1970 mr chavez who had built a commune-style union headquarters called la paz in a former sanitarium in keene near bakersfield began to complain that \"spies\" were trying to undermine the union this occurred after mr chavez befriended charles dederich the founder of synanon a drug rehabilitation organization some chavez associates said mr dederich advised him to be autocratic soon mr chavez purged the union of non-hispanic officials after mr brown departure from the governorship in 1983 mr chavez battled with the successor republican administration of george deukmejian whose campaign was backed by the growers in 1983 mr chavez expressing determination to recapture the union momentum revived the use of the boycott directed at nonunion table grapes and salinas valley lettuce by the end of 1985 growers said the high-tech boycott was having little effect on sales',\n",

       " 'max ernst the surrealist artist who was conspicuous even before world war i for his exceptional gifts and his power to startle and provoke died in paris yesterday he would have been 85 years old today ernst was prominent in the dada movement as well as in the surrealist movement; he made his mark as painter sculptor writer and maker of enigmatic objects but above all he functioned as a source of imaginative energy and as a witness to the evolution of the century he was an indispensable observer but he was also an indispensable participator: a one- man early-warning system who over and over again suggested that europe was in a bad way and likely to get worse his importance was not so much that he made covetable works of art--though he did indeed do that and in great numbers--but that as much as sigmund freud or franz kafka he was a part of his time max ernst was born on april 2 1891 in the little town of bruhe near cologne germany his father phillpp ernst was a schoolmaster who taught the deaf he was also a stern disciplinarian something of a mystic and a particularly pedestrian sunday painter max ernst was brought up in the strictest roman catholic tradition but his inquiring and insubordinate nature soon brought him into conflict with his family his school and his church deciding that small-town thoughts and small-town ways were not for him he became a precocious student both of nietzsche and of freud whose \"interpretation of dreams\" came out while max ernst was in high school he also concerned himself with abnormal psychology and in particular with the artistic achievement of mental patients which were then beginning to be investigated good judge of talent he traveled as and when he could from the age of 15 visiting museums painting and drawing from nature discovering a kinship with the early german painters who could be seen then as now in the museum in cologne by the time he entered the university of bonn in the winter of 1908-9 he had read all the new books and seen many of the new paintings that were setting the tone for the 20th-century in europe he learned fast and he was a very good judge of talent in others he soon came to know the \"young rhineland\" group which included franz marc and august macke both of whom made a considerable mark as painters before being killed in the first weeks of world war i he was one of the young germans who met the french poet guillaume apollinaire and the french painter robert delaunay when they visited the rhineland in 1913 this confirmed him in the belief that paris was the city in which he most wanted to live meanwhile he showed his work in the first german autumn salon in berlin in 1913; his fellow exhibitors included paul klee marc chagall and members of the italian futurist group he got to paris briefly in 1913 but any plans for a longer sojourn were confounded in august 1914 by the outbreak of world war i ernst served throughout the war in the german army partly in france and partly in what is now poland he was a reluctant but apparently invulnerable soldier whose immunity to even the heaviest blow on the head was such that his comrades nicknamed him \"the man with the iron skull\" he managed to go on painting and in 1916 he again showed his paintings in berlin; on that occasion he made the acquaintance of george grosz through his contacts in the art world he knew of the dada movement which had begun in new york and zurich and eventually made its way to cologne hanover berlin and paris one of its co-founders jean arp had been a friend of his since 1914; and when ernst was discharged from the army in 1918 and made his way back to cologne it turned out that he and arp were of one mind about the state of the world and the state of art \"we young people came back from the war\" he said later \"in a state of stupefaction at the absurdity the total swinishness and imbecility of what had gone on for four years we had to get back somehow at the \\'civilization\\' which was responsible for the war\" magic in his fingers ernst was ideally suited to the provocative and wholly unexpected methods of the dada movement like its other progenitors--francis picabia marcel duchamp man ray kurt schwitters and arp--he took it for granted that the physical life of what he produced might be short using whatever materials lay at hand--old engravings objects found in the street news photographs--he turned out to have magic in his fingers\\' ends it was a magic that was still in full operation nearly 60 years later he wanted to restate the claims of the imagination at a time when europe had ground to a halt and every single one of the beliefs on which the prewar world had been founded had proved to be false dada in cologne was a matter of intense exasperation both to the british army of occupation and to the german police ernst was delighted when the police closed the cologne dada exhibition and even more delighted when they came to him a few days later and said: \"would you mind opening up again having to shut it down has given the police such a bad name\" not long after his return to cologne he married louise strauss an art historian and in 1920 his son jimmy was born jimmy ernst has for many years been well known in new york as a painter the circumstances of max ernst life did not however favor a settled domesticity he was determined to get to paris where he already had a certain reputation with andre breton the future author of the \"surrealist manifestoes\" and with tristan tzara one of the founders of dadaism his first paris exhibition was held at the galerie au sans pareil in 1921; it consisted of collages that he had mailed in a brown paper parcel and it established him immediately as an artist conspicuous for his nimble wit his seemingly unlimited powers of invention and his dazzling way with the french language known for \\'celebes\\' during the summer of 1921 ernst links with france were further consolidated by his meeting with the poet paul eluard who thereafter became one of his closest friends in 1922 he entered france illegally and set up house with eluard and his wife gala later to become mrs salvador dali before long he became known for such monumental paintings as \"the elephant celebes\" now in the tate gallery in london \"oedipus rex\" and \"ubu imperator\" these combined solid craftsmanship with imagery that has never lost its power to disturb but the notion of settling down as a man who kept office hours painted regularly for an annual exhibition and in general fitted into the traditional patterns of the art world was abhorrent to ernst in the mid-1920 as it had been immediately after his discharge from the army he acted by instinct and on impulse in 1924 for instance he sold his entire output to a dealer in dusseldorf and set out for the far east to join eluard on what seemed to their friends to have been an unmotivated escapade unfettered imagination by the time he returned to paris in october 1924 breton had published his \"first surrealist manifesto\" the role of the unconscious in art had been formulated in terms not altogether unlike those that ernst might have formulated for himself as a student before 1914; and he himself was regarded as one of the principal ornaments of the surrealist movement he continued to invent new ways of making and combining images some of them calculated others involuntary he aimed at all times to keep his imagination unfettered; and for that the procedures of traditional painting in oils often seemed to him too slow too labored too lacking in spontaneity it was for this reason that so many of his most memorable achievements were owed to techniques of a freakish or idiosyneratic sort rubbing on wood cutting with a sharp pair of scissors importing ready-made elements like the ones used in the \"two children threatened by a nightingale\" which is now in the museum of modern art in new york he kept expectation at bay in his art he was a born solitary even if at times he drew close to friends like arp and joan miro or was delighted to join with eluard in publishing a book of poems in which it is very difficult to tell which lines were owed to which hand in the surrealist group over which breton ruled as an absolute autocrat he was an irreducible renagade to whom the very name of discipline was odious it was not surprising that in 1926 he fell afoul of breton for having made stage designs with miro for a diaghilev ballet called \"romeo and juliet\" there ensued between ernst and breton a hostility that continued until the day breton died it was in 1927 that ernst began on the great series of premonitory images that were in effect a portrait of the europe that was to come in \"the horde\" he showed a demonic army on the march in \"a vision inspired by the porte st denis at night\" he showed for the first but by no means the last time a great city shuttered and shattered disquiets of a more intimate sort were hinted at in painting after painting after his divorce from his first wife ernst in 1927 married marie-berthe aurenche; but it was not until his long and happy third marriage to the american painter dorothea tanning that he ceased to take the gloomiest possible view of the conjugal tie in 1929 ernst published what he called his \"collage-novel\" \"la femme 100 tetas\" like its successor \"une semaine de bonte\" 1934 this was made up primarily of altered engravings: plates from 19th-century pulp novels magazines of adventure or manuals of technical instruction he recombined in ways that could never be predicted taken together these two books form an encyclopedia of our century anxieties; and one astonishing for its resource its fiendish wit and its rare moments of lyrical repose in 1933 the year the nazis came to power in germany ernst painted \"the petrified city\" in which an unnamed acropolis is seen to have been turned to stone in the aftermath of an unidentified catastrophe paintings like \"the barbarians march west\" 1935 and \"the angel of hearth and home\" 1937 left the spectator in no doubt that ernst considered both society in general and the institution of domesticity to be in the worst possible way the war dance of the supposed angel in \"the angel of hearth and home\" is indeed one of the most sinister images in modern painting moved to avignon ernst had been singled out for disfavor among the nazis ever since 1933 when he made it quite clear in \"europe after the rain i\" that in his view europe was threatened by a calamity that could be likened to a great flood tide of filth all nature was poisoned for him by the changes that he saw in mankind but instinct led him even at the worst of times to build an ark for himself; and in 1938 he moved with the painter leonora carrington to a house not far from avignon france which he set himself to restore and decorate as if he would be living there forever with the outbreak of world war ii he found himself on the contrary in trouble with the french who interned him as an enemy alien when the german armies forced the french to surrender it became a matter of life and death for him to escape from france few men could be more difficult to imprison but even after repeated escapes it was as much as he could do to make his way with the help of his son jimmy and other americans to the united states in 1941 he arrived in new york with peggy guggenheim who eventually became his fourth wife he had his first show in new york at the julien levy gallery in 1932 and in 1936 alfred barr included him in the \"fantastic art dada surrealism\" exhibition at the museum of modern art though not unknown therefore he found it difficult to make a living by his work in the united states during world war ii once again he decided to make himself an ark: this time in sedona ariz which he first visited in 1943 it was during that year that he painted the large picture called \"vox angelica\" which is in effect a pictorial autobiography divided into well-judged compartments unlike many europeans who came to the united states as exiles at that time ernst took an enormous delight in the landscape the speech habits and the imaginative traditions of the united states what he did not so much care for--and what never ceased to rouse him to a fine fury of imprecation--was the accusation of \"moral turpitude\" that came his way when his tempestuous private life finally came to an idyllic culmination in the company of the young painter dorothea tanning this accusation was silenced when he and miss tanning were married in 1946 but it never ceased to rankle him that it should ever have been leveled arizona and the colorado river were a source of unending pleasure to ernst as were the films of w c fields and his new wife natural gaiety of spirit and freedom of speech but fundamentally he was still a european and once world war ii was over he began to think of returning to france a first postwar visit to paris in 1950 was the occasion of heartwarming re-encounters with arp eluard tzara alberto giacometti and others but in practical terms it was not quite so successful since ernst even at the age of 59 had nothing like the reputation he deserved he was indeed the last of the old masters of modern art to be given his due but when he was awarded the grand prize for painting at the venice biennale in 1954 public feeling at last began to swing his way; and over the next 20 years his reputation mounted steadily and without interruption he was almost to the end of his life a terrific worker nothing stopped him if his doctor was worried about his heart ernst took the cardiogram and used it as an ingredient in a picture if his doctor told him to stop working altogether ernst took off his painting overalls and used them too as an ingredient in a picture if illness came his way he bore it with a roman stoicism he had all the honors that he cared to accept in the 1960 and 70 all the exhibitions also the last great ernst show was one that began at the guggenheim museum in new york in 1975 and later moved to the grand palais in paris to those who met him at those times it seemed as if fame had long ago taken him by one hand and fortune by the other but it had not been so: for him to survive at all had needed a heart of iron and a nature of steel the late work lent itself even so to a euphoric interpretation it had an enforced gaiety a freshness and a felicity of invention that rarely failed him even when the demands for new work came in at a rate that would have daunted a man half his age there was still magic in his fingers\\' ends just as he had the same command of language the same upright and fiery stance before life and the same spectacularly fine looks that had astonished his new friends in france more than 50 years earlier he carried himself to the end as what he was: the only one of his kind',\n",
       " 'a man of missionary zeal and limitless curiosity henry robinson luce deeply influenced american journalism between 1923 when he and the late briton hadden founded time the weekly newsmagazine and 1964 when he retired as head of one of the world largest and richest publishing empires mr luce created the modern news magazine fostered the development of group journalism restyled pictorial reporting encouraged a crisp and adjective-studded style of writing and initiated the concept of covering business as a continuing magazine story in the process the tall lean man with heavy eyebrows grew to be one of the nation wealthiest men rose to a position of vast and pervasive economic political and social influence and helped shape the reading habits political attitudes and cultural tastes of millions nonetheless he tried to remain inconspicuous as a public figure in private his manner of living was notably inconspicuous \"we tell the truth as we see it\" mr luce once explained when his magazines took sides on controversies and he was accustomed to urge his editors to make a judgment he believed that objectivity was impossible \"show me a man who claims he is objective\" he told an interviewer \"and i\\'ll show you a man with illusions\" to a remarkable extent during the peak of his total involvement with his magazines--time fortune life and sports illustrated--the judgments and opinions that were printed reflected the focus of mr luce own views--and these encompassed virtually every facet of human endeavor he was a stanch republican a defender of big business and free enterprise a foe of big labor a steadfast supporter of chiang kai-shek an advocate of aggressive opposition to world communism he was also an anglophile but he believed that \"the 20th century must be to a significant degree the american century\" admired and criticized as with many who achieve eminence mr luce was lauded by those he benefited; he was cursed by those who felt injured by him and sometimes even by those men whose careers he had made virtually no one viewed him temperately yet admirer and critic respected his business accomplishments his ingenious brain his insatiable curiosity his editorial prescience for example he anticipated an american appetite for tersely packaged news for the photojournalism of life magazine and for the easy-to-grasp pictorial essay on such topics as \"the world we live in\" \"the world great religions\" and \"the human body\" mr luce was not gregarious especially convivial or given to mixing with those he considered his intellectual inferiors \"he lived well above the tree line on olympus\" one of his editors remarked after his formal retirement however mr luce tried hard to unbend but his fund of small talk was usually exhausted after a few moments of pleasantries attempting to explain the difference between the dour mr luce and the puckish time magazine a friend said: \"time is a side of luce called forth by the magic of the written word\" the luce enterprises which had an annual revenue of $503-million in 1966 were started on an $86000 shoestring in 1923 by mr luce and mr hadden the two schoolmates at hotchkiss and yale had for a long time discussed the idea of getting out a weekly magazine capsulizing the news for readers who wanted a condensed account of events vision of evangel \"people in america are for the most part poorly informed\" the prospectus for time declared this attitude and its implication that something ought to be done about it was one of the keys to mr luce conception of himself as an evangel it was an attitude ingrained from earliest childhood as was his tendency to evaluate many issues in moral terms he was born april 3 1898 in tengchow china the son of the rev dr henry winters luce a poor but socially well-connected presbyterian clergyman and teacher and elizabeth root luce a former young women christian association worker harry as the boy was known throughout his life was the first of four children serious minded and precocious harry luce learned chinese before he spoke english and composed sermons for boyhood diversion the household was run on spartan lines even though mrs cyrus h mccormick widow of the millionaire inventor was a family friend and benefactor the son adored the father a filial piety to which students of the editor-publisher traced his religious impulses him moralities and his zealous approach to life the son also developed a vigorous attachment to things chinese and all his life he regarded himself as an expert on china after attending a strict british boarding school at chefoo where caning was the practice harry came to the united states at 15 to attend hotchkiss school in lakeville conn on a scholarship he amassed a top academic record wrote verse edited the school literary monthly and became assistant managing editor of the weekly paper most fateful of all he became friendly with young briton hadden the paper managing editor shared journalistic interest the youths shared a deep interest in journalism and a judgment that too many people were ignorant of the world about them and ought to be enlightened the young men went to yale where both were editors of the daily news they graduated in 1920 with time out for military service in world war i mr luce a phi beta kappa was voted \"most brilliant\"\" in the class and mr hadden \"most likely to succeed\" after brief study at oxford mr luce returned to the united states and went to work for the chicago daily news as a legman for ben hecht he migrated from chicago to baltimore for a reporter job on the news where he was reunited with mr hadden in their spare time the youthful reporters developed plans for a weekly news magazine at first to be titled facts but then called time and put together the prospectus which pledged that the publication would have \"a prejudice against the rising cost of government; faith in the things which money cannot buy a respect for the old particularly in manners\" the prospectus also told how the new magazine would differ from literary digest then the reigning newslike weekly \"the digest in giving both sides of a question gives little or no hint as to which side it considers to be right\" mr luce and mr hadden said \"time gives both sides but clearly indicates which side it believes to have the stronger position\" mr luce and mr hadden quit their baltimore jobs in early 1922 to sell stock and get their publication under way the task took a year with 72 investors mostly from wall street chipping in $86000 toward their $100000 goal the first issue dated march 3 1923 divided the week news into 22 departments in 28 pages eighteen persons were listed on the first masthead 11 of them yale alumni the circulation manager was a harvard man roy e larsen who is now chairman of the executive committee of time inc he and mr luce and mr hadden paid themselves $40 a week ran business side the articles in the first issues were recast chiefly from the new york times by nimble writers by the flip of a coin it was decided at the outset of time that mr luce would manage its business affairs while mr hadden would run the editorial side it was mr hadden who fathered the idiosyncratic style by which the magazine became famous two elements of that style--the inverted sentence and the double epithet--were borrowed from \"the iliad\" \"the odyssey\" and \"the aeneid\" homer and virgil however might have been awe-struck by the license mr hadden and his writers took: \"fleet-footed achilles\" became \"beady-eyed\" or \"jut-jawed\" or \"snaggle-toothed\" or \"haystack-haired\" the homeric sentence \"brazen were the walls which ran this way and that from the threshold to the inmost chamber\" was transformed into the hadden-luce-time sentence \"to swanscott came a lank stern senator gray-haired level-browed\" time carly motto was \"curt clear and complete\" it contained an abundance of telescoped words such as \"gopolitics\" \"cinemaddict\" \"socialite\" \"freudulent\" and such an archaicism as \"moppet\" for child \"tycoon\" from the japanese taikun meaning prince was liberally applied to men of success action verbs were the mode and the dictionary was ransacked for alternatives to the verb \"said\" the saucy style was considerably toned down after wolcott gibbs wrote a merciless parody of it in a profile of mr luce for the new yorker magazine in 1936 the sketch contained two sentences that have become a part of the literary folklore: \"backward ran sentences until reeled the mind\" and \"where it will all end knows god!\" planned business journal when time began to show a profit in 1927 mr luce and mr hadden started tide a magazine for the advertising business which they sold in 1930 meantime in 1929 mr luce devoted himself to planning fortune which was to exemplify the thesis that \"business is obviously the greatest single denominator of interest among the active leading citizens of the usa  the distinctive expression of the american genius\" also in 1929 mr hadden died of a streptococcus infection and the editorial and business aspects of time inc shifted to mr luce the two men oddly were never intimate social friends although they always rallied to each other support publication of fortune began in 1930 the magazine looked luxurious cost the then high price of $1 a copy and contained excellent art in its first year it printed articles critical of some large corporations including the united states steel corporation but it eventually won acceptance for its perceptive reporting and for its major stories on technological change and life in the executive suite writers for time and fortune have included such noted social critics as archibald macleish john o\\'hara stephen vincent benet james agee and dwight macdonald not all of mr luce writers agreed with him or with his principles but they found his generous pay scales and his early friendly attitude toward the american newspaper guild irresistible bought architectural forum in 1932 mr luce purchased a trade publication architectural forum a reflection of his own interest at the time in architecture twenty years later it gave rise to house & home which specialized in home building the forum the largest magazine in its field but an economic loser was discontinued in 1964 house & home was sold that year to mcgraw-hill inc the most spectacularly popular of all luce publications was life magazine started in 1936 its announced purpose was: \"to see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events; to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud\" it brashly and splashily published photographs of statesmen in unguarded moments soldiers fighting to the death babies being born policemen clubbing strikers and models in the almost- nude there were gaudy layouts of surgical procedures and panoramas of nature later there were essays and memoirs heavily pictorialized and editorials on what was called \"the american purpose\" life magazine was a wedding gift of sorts to mr luce second wife his first marriage to lila ross hotz of chicago in 1923 ended in divorce in 1935 they had two sons henry 3d a vice president of time inc and chief of the magazine london bureau and peter paul a management consultant shortly after his divorce mr luce married mrs clare boothe brokaw daughter of a vaudeville couple and the divorced wife of george tuttle brokaw according to an article by john kobler in the saturday evening post in 1965 mr luce proposed to mrs brokaw then an editor of vanity fair and a fledging playwright at virtually their first meeting by asking her how it felt to know that \"you\\'re the only woman in a man life\" purchased title for $85000 the new mrs luce \"had been advocating photojournalism ever since she knew luce\" the account stated \"and he had told her \\'i don\\'t really want more magazines but if it pleases you we\\'ll go ahead\\'\" on their honeymoon it was said the couple shaped the magazine whose title was purchased for $85000 from the fading humor weekly because mrs luce had such a germinal role in the founding of life it was widely assumed that she exercised a great deal of direct influence over its policies and those of her husband other periodicals initially it was said mrs luce did play an open part but she limited herself to writing bylined articles for life after an argument with ralph ingersoll a life editor in the magazine early years mrs luce indirect influence however was reported to have been considerable her husband it was said listened to her suggestions for articles and proposed them under his own name in the beginning life magazine was overly successful its circulation outraced its advertising revenue although it was not until 1969 that it operated in the black started \\'march of time\\' mr luce final magazine venture was sports illustrated the title was also purchased started in 1954 to capitalize on what he called \"the wonderful world of sport\" and a more abundant leisure available to americans after world war ii the magazine appeal was primarily to families in the suburbs and smaller towns mr luce previously ignorant of most sports except golf and swimming undertook an intensive cram course in baseball boxing and horse racing to equip himself intellectually as publisher mr luce also had an early association with radio starting in 1928 with promotional broadcasts from time articles this developed into \"the march of time\" it ran for 15 years and its narrator westbrook van voorhis achieved fame for the solemn manner in which he intoned \"time marches on!\" the program catch phrase the series was also adapted for a period for the movies at his retirement in 1964 as editor in chief of all time inc publications mr luce was the company principal owner with a stock interest of 162 per cent the market value of his holdings then exceeded $42-million and his annual dividend income was $1263888 all told in 1964 luce magazines published 13 editions weekly or monthly with a world circulation of 13 million copies an issue mr luce influence in communications however went far beyond magazines it included production of television programs here and abroad; the operation of five radio and six television stations and the creation of a series of popular books on science and history time inc book division was said to have grossed $40-million in 1964 the company also owned a 45 per cent interest in the 48-story $70-million time & life building at the avenue of the americas and 50th street the man who nurtured the time inc enterprise from one-room simplicity to global complexity was a tall lean man with a large head of the sort that his baldness which began in middle life enhanced his eyes were light blue narrow and sharp under dark brows his mouth was thin his jaw firm almost from the start of time magazine mr luce communicated with his underlings by memorandums of which he was a prolific composer when he returned from trips--and he traveled incessantly--he dispatched memos that were obviously the work of a sharp-eyed observer and that often contained directives on whatever struck his agile mind as important when mr luce stepped down as editor in chief george p hunt life managing editor wrote that it had been \"a rigorous and rewarding experience\" to have had \"harry luce as a boss\" he also described the lucean memos: \"this comes in two forms the long ones are neatly typewritten the others consist of pencil scrawls on yellow pad paper often with a newspaper clipping attached by means of an ordinary straight pin the subjects of these memos were broad--a proposal to do a series on greece a critique of the latest issue of life a question about the latest teen-age fad a philosophical comment on united states politics\" in politics mr luce backed republican candidates for president in every campaign except 1928 when he supported alfred e smith he apparently also had some qualms about the republican candidate in 1964 for life that year carried an editorial critical of barry goldwater the party nominee mr luce voted for mr goldwater however mr luce sometimes liked to talk with his editors in person ts matthews formerly one of his principal editors recalled in his book \"name and address\" faulted on fairness mr matthew 1960 autobiography found mr luce secretive not always aware of other people yet a good editor and a man who could be answered back nonetheless mr matthews faulted mr luce on the question of fairness asserting that \"the presidential campaign of 1940 was the last one that time even tried to report fairly\" \"in 1952 when it sniffed victory in the air at long last\" mr matthews wrote \"there was no holding time the distortions suppressions and slanting of its political \\'news\\' seemed to me to pass the bounds of politics and to commit and offense against the ethics of journalism the climax was a cover story on adlai stevenson the democratic candidate which was a clumsy but malign and murderously meant attack\" mr matthews reported that he had not resigned over this incident he left the organization in the mid-fifties and subsequently wrote his autobiography mr luce curiosity was legendary correspondents who drove with him from an airport to the center of a city had to be prepared for all manner of detailed questions about the sights some to anticipate the cross-examination made dry runs from the airfield to town once one story has it mr luce spotting a large excavation asked his correspondent what it was \"that mr luce\" the man replied \"is a hole in the ground\" in addition to these impressions of mr luce there was a thinly distinguished portrait of him in \"death of kings\" a novel by charles wertenbaker once a high-ranking time editor many of mr luce associates thought the portrayal unflattering was seldom quoted mr luce wrote little about himself for publication and was seldom quoted in his own publications in his travels he talked to presidents premiers popes cardinals ambassadors bankers political leaders industrialists generals and admirals many in time inc close to mr luce were impressed by his ranging interests hedley donovan who succeeded mr luce as editor in chief recalled that his superior had \"an extraordinary zeal for new ideas not only as inspiration for new modes and vehicles of journalism but as a subject matter for journalism\" \"far from being pained by new ideas\" mr donovan said \"harry luce rejoices in them he welcomes argument so ardently that it takes a certain amount of intellectual courage to agree with him when he is right as is bound to happen from time to time\" this was also the impression of gilbert cant a time editor for many years who said: \"his decisions may have been unidirectional but by god he thought a hell of a lot conversation with him was utterly maddening because he was always aware of the other side of any proposition he was stating and he frequently tried to express both sides at once\" a belief in a christian god animated much of mr luce thinking a man who attended church regularly and prayed before he went to bed he contended that the united states had a \"constitutional dependency on god\" he often used the word \"righteousness\" to describe the causes he espoused mr luce however was not a dogmatic protestant he concurred in his wife right to convert to roman catholicism in 1946 and he was said to respect her view of the world without adopting it for his own after a career as a playwright \"the women\" \"kiss the boys goodbye\" and \"margin for error\" mrs luce also an ardent republican served two terms in

       " 'muddy waters who played a key role in the development of electric blues and rock-and- roll and was the greatest contemporary exponent of the influential mississippi delta blues style died in his sleep early yesterday at his home near chicago the singer and guitarist was pronounced dead at chicago good samaritan hospital reportedly of a heart attack he was 68 years old beginning in the early 1950 mr waters made a series of hit records for chicago chess label that made him the undisputed king of chicago blues singers he was the first popular bandleader to assemble and lead a truly electric band a band that used amplification to make the music more ferociously physical instead of simply making it a little louder in 1958 he became the first artist to play electric blues in england and while many british folk-blues fans recoiled in horror his visit inspired young musicians like mick jagger keith richards and brian jones who later named their band the rolling stones after mr waters early hit \"rollin\\' stone\" bob dylan mid-1960 rock hit \"like a rolling stone\" and the leading rock newspaper rolling stone were also named after mr waters original song mr waters played his blues at carnegie hall in 1959 and in 1960 he made a triumphant appearance at the newport jazz festival where he introduced his blues hit \"got my mojo working\" to white music fans his music was widely imitated by a generation of young white musicians and virtually all the leading rock guitarists who emerged in the 1960 including eric clapton jeff beck jimmy page and johnny winter named muddy waters as one of their earliest and most important influences mr clapton returned the favor by hiring mr waters to open the concerts on one of his american tours of the 1970 where hundreds of thousands of rock fans heard mr waters mr waters made his final concert appearance last june when he performed his early hit \"blow wind blow\" in an eric clapton show in miami but muddy waters was more than a major influence in the pop music world he was a great singer of american vernacular music a vocal artist of astonishing power range depth and subtlety among musicians and singers his remarkable sense of timing his command of inflection and pitch shading and his vocabulary of vocal sounds and effects from the purest falsetto to grainy moaning rasps were all frequent topics of conversation and he was able to duplicate many of his singing techniques on electric guitar using a metal slider to make the instrument \"speak\" in a quivering voice-like manner his blues sounded simple but it was so deeply rooted in the traditions of the mississippi delta that other singers and guitarists found it almost impossible to imitate it convincingly \"my blues looks so simple so easy to do but it not\" mr waters said in a 1978 interview \"they say my blues is the hardest blues in the world to play\" mckinley muddy waters morganfield was born april 4 1915 in rolling fork in the southern mississippi delta near highway 61 his father ollie morganfield farmed and played blues guitar but his parents separated when he was six months old and he went to live with his maternal grandmother on a plantation outside clarksdale miss a town in the central delta where john lee hooker and other future blues and gospel stars grew up his grandmother began calling him \"muddy\" when he was a baby because he liked playing in the mud and when he was a child on the plantation playmates added the surname \"waters\" muddy waters began making music when he was 3 or 4 years old he began performing on harmonica at country picnics and fish fries when he was 12 or 13 and had plenty of opportunity to watch older blues singers and guitarists robert johnson influenced him and so did the impassioned singer-guitarist son house but he also listened to commercial blues recordings by memphis minnie lonnie johnson tampa red and blind lemon jefferson on a neighbor phonograph in 1941 and 1942 alan lomax and john work recorded mr waters in mississippi for the library of congress hearing himself on records encouraged mr waters to try to make commercial recordings and in 1943 he moved to chicago the following year he acquired an electric guitar and by 1948 his band with jimmy rogers on second guitar little walter on harmonica and baby face leroy on guitar and drums was the most popular blues combo working on chicago black south side he recorded for columbia records and for aristocrat in 1948 and his recording career took off after aristocrat owned by leonard and phil chess became chess records with muddy waters as its leading blues artist in the early and middle 1950 muddy waters and his band made a number of records popular with black record buyers especially in the deep south and in middle western cities with large populations of southerners like chicago and detroit the songs mr waters recorded and performed in the 1950 included \"hoochie coochie man\" \"just make love to me\" \"she moves me\" \"mannish boy\" and \"louisiana blues\" his songs some of which were original while others came from the blues tradition or were written for him by willie dixon are still in the repertories of countless blues and rhythm-and-blues bands in the united states and around the world he received widespread recognition in the 1970 including six grammy awards and a dynamic featured performance in martin scorcese 1978 film \"the last waltz\" mr waters never grew rich from his music but he was able to work virtually as often as he wanted to and in recent months he had been taking time off \"enjoying the fruits of his labor\" according to his manager scott cameron he lived comfortably in westmont ill a chicago suburb his most recent albums recorded for the columbia distributed blue sky label and produced by his longtime admirer the rock guitarist johnny winter sold better than all but a handful of his earlier recordings and he was proud of them \"this

but the day of his death was announced by telegraph and cable to many parts of the world he began life as \"just another little nigger\" on a plantation of a family named burrows in hale ford va the month and year of his birth were probably april 1858 although dr washington himself was not sure of this in the biographical paragraph under his name in \"who who in america\" it is said that he was born \"about 1859\" the only certain fact is that he was born into slavery when negro mothers made no record of nor long remembered the date of a child birth soon after the close of the civil war the little negro boy went with his stepmother to malden west va where he worked in salt furnaces for nine moths in the year and attended school for three months after several years of such life the boy obtained work in the kitchen of mrs viola ruffner a new england woman who had married a southerner mrs ruffner soon recognized the boy eagerness and ability to advance himself so she taught him the elementary subjects booker washington felt grateful to her to the end of his life because she really gave him his start he heard of the hampton institute for negroes in 1871 when he was about thirteen years old and he decided at once to attend it so with the little money he had been able to save from his wages of $6 a week he set out for richmond va hoping to earn enough there to enable him to go on to hampton which is near norfolk this was in 1871 dr washington founded the tuskeegee institute just ten years later he was admitted to the institute and was graduated at the head of his class in 1875 after working his way through the school after graduation dr washington returned to malden and taught school until he had earned enough to enable him to go to the wayland seminary in washington d c where he studied until 1879 when he was called to hampton as a teacher in the institute after he had taught for two years in 1881 the state of alabama voted to found an industrial institute for negroes similar to that at hampton and after searching for a negro qualified to head the proposed institution dr washington was selected this was his entrance into the \"black belt\" of the south a chance which he had long desired and when he assumed charge of the institute at tuskegee ala his real life work began the start of tuskegee the state had appropriated $2000 a year and it was the task of the negro to organize the school how well he did this is shown by a comparison of statistics the institute opened on july 4 1881 with one teacher and thirty pupils at that time it had neither land nor buildings nothing but the $2000 a year granted by the alabama legislature when the institute celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary it owned 2000 acres of land and eighty-three large and small buildings which with its equipment of live stock stock in trade and other personal property were valued at $831895 this did not include 22000 acres of public land remaining unsold from the 25000 acres granted by congress valued at $135000 nor the endowment fund which was $1275644 during the year there were more than 1500 students enrolled in the school more than 1000 young men and more than 500 young women the students were trained in thirty-seven industries it was on the opening day of the atlanta exposition in 1895 that dr washington became a national character on that day he delivered an address that was heard by thousands and read by other thousands in far-away places with wonder that a man so wise and clear- seeing should arise from among his people to lead them upward for it was because dr washington stood out as a negro striving in a sensible and sincere way to help negroes that he commanded attention on that day in atlanta his subject was \"the new negro\" and white men saw in what he said a sane hope for the negro race and a real solution of the vexing \"negro problem\" the character and difficulties of dr washington work are told in a magazine article written by him when elected to organize the tuskegee institute he traveled through the \"black belt\" in order to become acquainted with the people whom he was to teach \"in the plantation districts\" he wrote later \"i found large families including visitors when any appeared living and sleeping in a single room i found them living on fat pork and corn bread and yet not infrequently i discovered in these cabins sewing machines which no one knew how to use which had cost as much as $60 or showy clocks which had cost as much as $10 or $12 but which never told the time i remember a cabin where there was but one fork on the table for the use of five members of the family and myself while in the opposite corner was an organ for which the family was paying $60 in monthly installments the truth that forced itself upon me was that these people needed not only book learning but knowledge of how to live; they needed to know how to cultivate the soil to husband their resources and make the most of their opportunities\" men of affairs come to his aid word of his aims advertised to the world in the atlanta speech spread all over the country and soon men and women of means began to want to assist dr washington chief among these was andrew carnegie who began by giving a $20000 library to the institute which he followed with a regular contribution of $10000 a year the climax of mr carnegie generosity toward the institute was reached in 1903 when he gave $600000 to the endowment fund among those who indorsed and supported dr washington by act and speech were presidents mckinley roosevelt taft and wilson; the officials of many states and the heads of many institutions of learning though he never seemed to seek them honors of all kinds were bestowed upon the negro the degree of m a was conferred upon him by harvard in 1896 and ll d by dartmouth in 1901 in 1910 when dr washington was in europe he was received by the king of denmark addressed the national liberal club in london and visited mr carnegie in skibo castle among those who gave the most effectual assistance to dr washington in his work was robert curtis ogden who died in maine on aug 6 1913 mr ogden became interested in negro educational work through his association with general samuel chapman armstrong the founder of the hampton institute and as the president of the southern educational board he did much to overcome southern prejudice against the education of negroes and spread the knowledge of hampton and tuskegee among both the white and black people an incident of dr washington life that stirred up a controversy throughout the country was the occasion of his dining at the white house with president roosevelt on oct 16 1901 dr washington went to the white house at the invitation of the president and when the news was spread abroad thousands both north and south who were moved by race prejudice or by a belief that social equality between blacks and whites had been encouraged became angry most of the criticism fell upon colonel roosevelt but the incident served also to injure dr washington work in some parts of the south in addition to his work at tuskegee and upon the lecture platform dr washington wrote a number of books and pamphlets upon the negro question chief among his works were: \"sowing and reaping\" 1900;

was 64 years old and lived in northboro with dr m c chang a senior scientist of the worcester foundation and dr john rock head of the rock reproductive clinic of brookline mass dr pincus developed a relatively safe and simple oral contraceptive that revolutionized family planning the pill as it has come to be called not only revolutionized methods of birth control but also introduced the previously taboo topic as a subject for worldwide debate on curbing overpopulation women were cautious in accepting it when it was first marketed in 1960 but today more than six million american women--nearly one-fifth of those of childbearing age--are believed to be using it--and the number is growing dr pincus was research director of the worcester foundation for experimental biology and his interest included many aspects of hormone studies he was an authority in mammalian reproduction and a pioneer in cancer research in the late nineteen-forties dr pincus focused his attention on the role of hormones in his study of reproduction with a grant from the national institute of arthritis and metabolic diseases of the public health service in the fifties he began a study of the properties of hydrocortisone an adrenal hormone these experiments involved the use of progesterone a female hormone secretion that is triggered by ovulation the hormone thickens the walls of the fallopian tubes and the womb in preparation for the fertilized egg progesterone also safeguards against overlapping pregnancies by preventing further fertilization and thus serves as a natural birth-control agent dr pincus and dr chang began to discuss the possibility of a synthetic progesterone they experimented with more than 200 substances before settling upon three steroid compounds derived from the roots of the wild mexican yam these seemed to prevent ovulation in laboratory animals it was at this time that the two biologists teamed up with dr rock a roman catholic gynecologist and obstetrician who was also working with progesterone to cure infertility in his childless patients dr chang made the basic experimental observations while dr pincus worked the findings into the over-all research scheme \"pincus can interrupt a critical problem to take 10 phone calls and then switch his mind back to the problem in a second\" an associate said \"recognizing people and human frailties as they exist he has freed himself from emotional turbulence\" in 1956 dr pincus began experiments in brookline mass puerto rico and haiti with the steroids in pill form on hundreds of women again success was reported in 1957 the food and drug administration authorized the marketing of the steroids for miscarriage and certain menstrual disorders and in 1960 the federal agency licensed enovid a contraceptive pill the pill is believed to be 100 per cent effective and the very few pregnancies that have been reported among pill-users are believed to be errors in negligence in remembering to take the pill the pill is taken daily for 20 days during which time ovulation is impossible the egg instead of being released and passed into the fallopian tubes where fertilization could take place is simply reabsorbed within the ovary within five days after the pills are stopped the woman begins to menstruate again on the fifth day of menstruation the next 20-day pill cycle is begun dr chang and dr pincus had been working recently on a new pill known popularly as the \"morning-after\" pill it affects the egg after ovulation during the seven days or more required for the fertilized egg to become implanted in the uterus the pill expels the egg from the fallopian tubes and uterus before implantation can occur dr pincus was also credited with the development of estrone a hormone used in the treatment of breast cancer and pregnancy complications dr pincus a bushy-haired man with a gray mustache and dark burning eyes was born in woodbine n j on april 9 1903 and later credited two uncles both agricultural scientists as responsible for his early interest in research \"as long as i can remember i knew i was going to be a scientist\" he once recalled he went to cornell and received a bachelor degree in agriculture in 1924 then he went to harvard where he was an instructor in zoology while also working toward his master and doctorate degrees from 1927 to 1930 he moved from harvard to cambridge university in england to the kaiser wilhelm institute in berlin conducting research he became an instructor in general physiology at harvard in 1930 and was promoted a year later to assistant professor by 1938 at the age of 35 he was already an international authority on the sex of mammals and sex hormones and more than 70 of his research papers had been published dr pincus became known to the general public when newspapers printed articles about his experiments and research with \"fatherless\" rabbits in 1939 while a professor of experimental zoology at clark university in worchester mass he brought about the first fatherless mammalian birth in history by inducing parthenogenesis in a female rabbit he used high temperature hormone treatments and salt solutions to fertilize the ovum in a test tube he then implanted the developing egg in the reproductive tract of the female rabbit where the egg matured through the normal stages but the research also caused him prolonged embarrassment in may of that year he went to toronto to report on his experiments to a meeting of the federation of american societies for experimental biology he said emphatically that he was not planning to carry on his experiments with rabbits to see if human babies could be made by test-tube method but a report of his remarks omitted the word \"not\" and he was thereafter called upon frequently both here and abroad to deny that he was trying \"to create human life in the laboratory\" the worcester foundation had been created the previous year and dr pincus and dr hoagland interested local businessmen and professionals in raising funds to purchase a 12-acre estate at shrewsbury mass where the foundation main buildings are now located the foundation was formally incorporated in 1944 with dr pincus as a co-director the 20th anniversary report indicated some of the scope of the foundation activities: research in the fields of steroids cancer research studies of the human aging process possible chemical causes of schizophrenia and other mental diseases and the relationship of hormones to heart disease in 1940 he was asked what he saw in the future on the basis of his early experiments \"i can\\'t tell\" he replied \"but there are no big steps there are all little steps we have to follow processes systematically the big questions are: why does an egg start to develop and why does it continue to develop\" concurrent with his work at the foundation dr pincus served as research professor at the tufts college medical school from 1946 to 1950 and as research professor in biology at boston university from 1950 until his death the work of the foundation attracted eminent scientists from all parts of the world more than 300 scientists from 40 countries are currently involved in foundation research dr pincus was a member or chairman of many important research committees of the national institute of health of the united states public health service and also of the national research council he was the recipient of numerous prizes and awards including the albert d lasker award in planned parenthood 1960; the modern medicine award for distinguished achievement in 1964; and the american medical association scientific achievement award in 1967 his books included \"the eggs of mammals\" published in 1936 and \"the control of fertility\" published in 1965 dr pincus is survived by his widow the former elizabeth notkin whom he married in 1924; a son john; a daughter mrs laura bernard; three brothers lee maurice and alexis; a sister mrs charles o dutton and four grandchildren a funeral service will be held on friday at 11 am at temple emanuel chandler street worcester burial will be private',\n",
       " 'charleston sc oct 29--joseph pulitzer proprietor of the new york world and st louis post-dispatch died aboard his yacht the liberty in charleston harbor at 1:40 o\\'clock this afternoon the immediate cause of mr pulitzer death was heart disease although he had been in poor health for some time there was no suspicion on the part of those accompanying him that his condition was serious the change for the worse came at about 2 o\\'clock this morning when he suffered an attack of severe pain by daylight he appeared to be better and fell asleep soon after 10:30 he awoke at 1 o\\'clock and complained of pain in his heart soon he fell into a faint and expired at 1:40 o\\'clock mrs pulitzer who had been sent for arrived from new york today and reached the yacht shortly before her husband died at his bedside also when the end came was his youngest son herbert who has been cruising with his father mr pulitzer body will be taken north at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon on a special pullman car the funeral will be held at woodlawn cemetery in new york probably toward the end of this week mr pulitzer son joseph jr is now on his way from st louis with his wife and one of his daughters will come from florida ralph pulitzer the eldest son is on the way to charleston and will meet the train en route up to an hour and a half before his death mr pulitzer mind remained perfectly clear his german secretary had been reading to him an account of the reign of louis the eleventh of france in whose career mr pulitzer had always taken the liveliest interest as the secretary neared the end of his chapter and came to the death of the french king mr pulitzer said to him: \"leise ganz leise ganz leise\" softly quite softly these were the last words he spoke some members of mr pulitzer party will go north to-morrow on the train with mrs pulitzer herbert pulitzer and the body of the dead journalist the other members of the party will remain on the yacht which will probably sail for new york to-morrow mr pulitzer yacht has been in charleston harbor for six days she was on the way to jekyl island near brunswick ga where mr pulitzer had a winter home on account of the threatening weather and the reported west indian hurricane however she put into charleston mr pulitzer was attended in his last illness by dr robert wilson of charleston and dr guthman mr pulitzer physician mr pulitzer accompanied by his younger son herbert left new york aboard his yacht on oct 18 intending to take a leisurely voyage to jekyl island aside from a heavy cold which had prevented him from taking his daily drives in central park mr pulitzer was in his usual health when he left this city he was taken ill on friday and the yacht put into charleston his illness proving serious a telegram was sent to his wife who left new york for charleston yesterday joseph pulitzer career was a striking example of the opportunities that have been found in the united states for advancement from penury and friendlessness to wealth and power few who have come here to find their fortunes have been more handicapped at the start he was without funds had no acquaintances in this country did not know the language and suffered from defective vision which harassed him all his life and made sad his last years when he was compelled practically to retire from active work few have had struggles more severe yet at 31 thirteen years after landing at castle garden he was the owner of a daily newspaper and on the road to riches mr pulitzer influence on the development of modern american journalism has been large in the first issue of the st louis post-dispatch he gave expression to those ideals as follows: the post and dispatch will serve no party but the people; will be no organ of republicanism but the organ of truth will follow no caucuses but its own convictions; will not support the administration but criticise it; will oppose all frauds and shams wherever and whatever they are; will advocate principles and ideas rather than prejudices and partisanship in assuming proprietorship of the new york world mr pulitzer said: there is room in this great and growing city for a journal that is not only cheap but bright not only bright but large not only large but truly democratic--dedicated to the cause of the people rather than that of purse potentates--devoted more to the news of the new than the old world; that will expose all fraud and sham; fight all public evils and abuses; that will serve and battle for the people with earnest sincerity joseph pulitzer was born in budapest in 1847 his father was a business man supposedly of means but when he died while joseph was still a boy it was found that the estate was very small in order that he might not be a burden on his mother joseph determined to enter the army he applied to his uncle who was a colonel in the austrian army but when he was examined as to physical fitness he was rejected because of the defect in one of his eyes he went to germany and sought to enter th prussian army but was again rejected for the same reason he tried to enlist in france and england with the same result the civil war was in progress in this country and he decided to come here it exhausted his resources to pay his passage and he landed at castle garden in 1864 practically penniless he knew nobody in this country and could speak only a dozen words of english within a few days however he met a fellow-countryman who had just enlisted in a german cavalry regiment then being raised in this city men were badly needed in the union army and the requirements as to sharpness of vision were not as strict as in time of peace the young austrian was enrolled and served to the end of the war in the lincoln cavalry as the regiment was called part of the time under sheridan when he was mustered out at its close in new york city he was still ignorant of english as his soldier companions had all been of foreign birth and spoke their native languages another austrian who had been his close companion suggested that they go west to seek their fortunes they went to a railroad ticket office threw down all the money they had between them and asked for passage as far west as their capital would take them it was thus by chance that mr pulitzer went to st louis their tickets were only to east st louis ill across the river from the missouri city there was no bridge in those days but pulitzer made himself acquainted with the fireman on a ferryboat and offered to do his firing if he would take him across he not only got across by this means but was continued at work as a fireman until he became a stevedore on the wharves of st louis after alternating as stevedore and as fireman on boats plying between st louis and new orleans for some time he had enough money saved to start in business as a boss stevedore in st louis this was his first enterprise and it was not a success its failure left him again penniless and with his strength diminished he applied to an employment agency for lighter work and got a place as a coachman in a private family here again his defective vision proved a handicap and after two weeks he was discharged because his employer feared he would run into something pulitzer vainly sought employment in every direction there was a cholera epidemic in st louis and the undertakers were in need of help to bury the hundreds who died he eagerly took up this work and was soon digging trenches on arsenal island he went from one humble employment to another until a st louis politician noting his ignorance of american ways induced him to take a post that no well-informed person would have undertaken in the reconstruction days after the close of the war missouri was largely in the hands of bushwhackers and guerrillas in order to have the charter of the st louis & san francisco railroad recorded in each county of the state it was necessary that the papers should be personally filed with the clerk of every county and it was expected that the man engaged in the task would almost certainly lose his life pulitzer realized nothing of this and started off joyously on a horse provided for him he completed the task and returned to st louis still in ignorance of the risk he had run this experience marked the turning point in his early struggles it gave him a knowledge which no other man then possessed of the land conditions of every county in the state and real estate men found his services invaluable even during his earlier vicissitudes he had been a voracious reader and eager student and had already begun to study law this he went ahead with rapidly and in 1868 four years after he landed at castle garden he was admitted to the bar he practiced for a short time but the profession was too slow for him he was bursting with ambition and energy and found it impossible to confine himself to the tedious routine of a young attorney he looked about for some manner of life in which he could bring all his suppressed energies into immediate play he found it in journalism he became a reporter for the westliche post a german paper edited by carl schurz his first appearance in this capacity was recently described by one who had been at the time a reporter on an english paper as follows: i remember his appearance distinctly because he apparently had dashed out of the office upon receiving the first intimation of whatever was happening without stopping to put on his coat or collar in one hand he held a pad of paper and in the other a pencil he did not wait for inquiries but announced that he was the reporter for the westliche post and then he began to ask questions of everybody in sight i remember to have remarked to my companions that for a beginner he was exasperatingly inquisitive the manner in which he went to work to dig out the facts however showed that he was a born reporter mr pulitzer chief ambition at that time seemed to be to root out public abuses and expose evildoers in work of this kind he was particularly indefatigable and absolutely fearless this was 1868 and before the year was over he had risen to city editor and later to managing editor still later he became part owner of the paper in the meantime he had begun taking an active part in national and local politics in 1869 he was elected to the missouri legislature though but twenty-two years old and only five years after he had landed here penniless and ignorant of the language in 1872 he was a delegate to the cincinnati convention that nominated horace greeley as the democratic candidate for the presidency in 1874 he sold his interest in the paper and went abroad to complete his education but soon returned to this country that same year he was a member of the missouri constitutional convention during the bitter contest that followed the tilden-hayes campaign mr pulitzer served the new york sun at washington as special correspondent and editorial writer his articles were of vitriolic brilliancy and appeared over his own name a departure that was rare in those days he continued this work until 1878 when he again visited europe on his return in the fall of that year he went to st louis where the evening dispatch was to be sold at auction after a precarious existence of several years mr pulitzer bought it for $2500 when he entered the office the next morning as proprietor of his own newspaper he was unable to find as much as a bushel of coal or a roll of white paper more complete ruin and decay were never seen in a newspaper office by impressing into service everybody within reach he managed to get out an issue of 1000 copies he set to work at once with characteristic energy to improve the situation at that time the journalistic field in the west was occupied almost exclusively by morning papers there were two other afternoon papers in st louis the post and the star within forty-eight hours he had absorbed the post and the first number of the post-dispatch which afterward became an enormous success was issued during this period his political activities continued in 1880 he was a delegate to the democratic national convention and in 1884 he was elected to congress from a new york district the duties of this position so interfered with his journalistic affairs that he resigned after a few months\\' service it was just at this time in fact that he bought the new york world from jay gould the world had never made a striking success it had been started in june 1880 as a penny paper of absolutely blameless features eschewing in its make-up intelligence of scandals divorces and even dramatic news its backing was ample but it failed to make money mr pulitzer bought this moribund paper and took possession may 10 1883 enormous difficulties confronted him from the start by the adoption of methods similar to those he had employed in st louis however mr pulitzer soon had the world on a paying basis of these beginnings the world itself recently said: he was unable to expend large sums of money in the gathering of news for the very excellent reason that he did not have it to spend he did instill life and energy into every department of the paper on the very first day of his proprietorship and in no part was the change in the character of matter printed more noticeable than in the news columns but it is a fact patent to any one who will turn over the files for that year that the first impetus given to the new world came from the editorial page to this mr pulitzer gave his personal and almost undivided attention and by this agency first impressed upon the public mind the fact that a new vigorous and potent moral force had sprung up in the community of late years mr pulitzer health had not been of the best his old eye trouble making impracticable the prolonged devotion to work that characterized his early career he had been obliged to spend much of his time abroad or at his country seat at bar harbor but his hand was felt directing the destinies of the world no matter in what corner of the globe he happened to be mr pulitzer had one of the most expensive households in america he had a home in east seventy-third street a fine estate at bar harbor and another country place on jekyl island off the georgia coast also he usually had two or three places abroad under lease and a 1500-ton steam yacht that added $100000 a year to his expenditures his blindness made it necessary for him to have a large personal staff no man kept more closely in touch with what was going on in the world and all the information had to come to him by word of mouth he could not read; he could not distinguish the faces of those about him he could only listen and think of his homes he liked bar harbor best and often remained there long after the winter snow was on the ground in summer he rose early and if the weather was fine he breakfasted on his own private veranda with his physician and companion who told him the important events in the day news then came an exhausting business session with his private secretary which usually lasted two hours then becoming weary and needing the air and sunshine he went out to drive or to ride in an electric launch ever bidding the boatman to head into the breeze then he was ready to work with his newspaper secretary who had been going over the newspapers since early morning digesting not only the world but its contemporaries sometimes he had a visitor from the office maybe the chief editorial writer or the managing editor or a reporter this session usually lasted about two hours and then mr pulitzer was ready for luncheon with the family in his entourage was usually a professional pianist usually a german after two hours of music mr pulitzer had one of his staff read to him usually a novel until he was ready to sleep when in new york he rode through central park early in the morning but the hours were even more crowded with work he completely tired out every one of his men who was associated with him also he kept them busy when they were away from him his own capacity for work was so enormous that he thought the tasks that would be play for him were equally easy for others since attaining affluence mr pulitzer had given considerable sums to philanthropy chiefly in the cause of education to the city of new york he gave a dozen or more free scholarships of $250 each for poor pupils anxious to gain a college education in making this annual gift mr pulitzer said: my especial object is to help the poor; the rich can help themselves i believe in self- made men but it is not the aim of this plan to help people for ordinary money-making purposes college education is not needed for that there are nobler purposes in life and my hope is not that these scholarships will make better butchers bakers brokers and bank cashiers but that they will help to make teachers scholars physicians authors journalists judges lawyers and statesmen they certainly ought to increase not diminish the number of those who under our free institutions rise from the humblest to the highest positions i have not entered upon this scheme without careful thought it was a dream of youth it is the conviction of experience subsequently mr pulitzer gave to columbia university an endowment of $1000000 for the establishment of a school of journalism which it has been understood would be utilized after his death after he had become wealthy he often referred to his early struggles in conversation with his intimates one night while strolling about the city with col john a cockerill one of the world editors he pointed to a bench in madison square on which a poor decayed specimen of humanity was stretched \"that\" he said \"is where i also slept many a night i had no bed when i first came to this city; i had no roof over my head every pleasant night until i found employment i slept upon that bench and my summons to breakfast was frequently the rap of a policeman club\" \"what did you do about rainy nights\" asked cockerill \"come with me\" was the answer mr pulitzer took his companion nearly two miles further down broadway and turning into park place showed him a number of truck which were placed there every evening on account of the insufficiency of stable room in that locality these vehicles were long and broad and roomy and while the bed of cobblestones beneath them was not altogether soft yet it was drier than that furnished by an uncovered bench pointing beneath one of these mr pulitzer said: \"under such a wagon as that and on that spot i slept on rainy nights\" mr pulitzer was married in 1877 to miss kate davis of washington a niece of jefferson davis he leaves five children joseph pulitzer jr ralph herbert constance and edith ralph pulitzer married miss frederica vanderbilt webb daughter of w seward webb in 1905 joseph pulitzer jr was married last year his wife was miss eleanor wickham of st louis mr pulitzer daughters are both unmarried london oct 30--the news of the death of joseph pulitzer reached london too late for editorial comment in this morning papers in fact only one paper received the news in time for publication in the regular editions this was the daily mail which prints half a column obituary reciting the facts of mr pulitzer life the times briefly announces the death in a late edition following it with a short record of mr pulitzer career in which it says: \"journalism was the work of his life the world under mr pulitzer management attained not only a huge circulation but the reputation of being the yellowest journal in the united states of america a supremacy which even to-day is only challenged by mr hearst american\" joseph pulitzer was the founder and foremost exemplar of modern journalism--the great originator and exponent of the journalism of action and achievement in his conception the newspaper was not merely a money-making machine it was the instrument of the will and power of its hundreds of thousands of readers the fulcrum upon which that power could be exerted in the accomplishment of broad and beneficial results jospeh pulitzer knew the necessity of making his newspapers financially successful and he was an able business man but it is as a great editor that he will be most honored and remembered joseph pulitzer was a democrat in doctrine and in deed he came from the people understood the aims and aspirations of the people sympathized with the sentiments of the people and labored to express in his newspapers the popular need and the popular will not the great success which joseph pulitzer achieved nor the great wealth which he accumulated nor his association with men of selfish purposes and class prejudices ever deprived him of his essential democracy or calloused him to the requirements of the democratic masses the cause of the people joseph pulitzer and his newspapers ever espoused ably and intelligently sympathetically and powerfully in his death journalism has lost a leader the people a champion the nation a valuable citizen may his sons continue his far-reaching work for their father greater glory for their own reputation and for the public good mr pulitzer death removes a remarkable figure in american journalism it is too soon to pass a final judgment upon his career or his influence upon the profession nor would such a critical estimate be fitting from an individual at this hour but it may be permitted me to say that the evolution of the world into a fearless outspoken independent newspaper with a trenchant editorial page has made it an invaluable force on the side of the people in their battle against special privilege and that form of \"legalized graft\" known as protective tariff for this mr pulitzer must long be gratefully remembered however one may have differed from him in matters of journalistic taste or dissent from some other form his journalism has taken i have known mr pulitzer for many years and think i knew him pretty well he always gave to me the impression of a man of great force far vision extraordinary audacity of thought strong confidence in himself and rare power to discern the currents and quicken the velocity of public opinion he was peremptory versatile untiring and could stamp his views so indelibly on his co-workers as to make them feel they had always been their views which he had drawn out of them instead of forced into them by his dynamic personality in finance or exploration or manufacturing or any grand division of resourcefulness he might have addressed his genius and energy to results as single and signal as those he wrought in journalism the latter calling however enabled what was within him to be expended on what was without him the reciprocal impact of events and himself on one another produced effects of which the news pages of his paper were the evidence pages in which he contributed not a little and to which he inspired his co-workers to contribute to the limit of his power to affect them and of their ambition as his unconscious imitators and understands to rival please and if possible exceed him that was the executive achieving creative or magnified and picturesque news side of him the editorial side of him if i may so differentiate was essentially idealistic his red-hot earnestness on that side was extraordinary what he saw or foresaw he did not wait for the trailing pace of slower intelligences gradually to approach his was a glorious impatience and a magnificent precipitancy nor did it matter to him that his latest convictions might conflict with his former and discarded impressions them he could shed as events showed they were partial and imperfect his trend was forward his sentiency was acute his political ideality was a part of his genius his optimism his intellectual mutability his scorn for sheer consistency which he estimated as an infirmity of mediocre minds opaque to vision and regarding deity as worthy of worship only as deity was a slight extension of themselves i knew mr pulitzer as well as he allowed those he had no purpose to use to know him yet i doubt i knew him thoroughly for he had reserves of intent and of intensity that those nearer to him than i could probably better know or more accurately surmise than i affairs journalism all divisions of energy and endeavor will miss him but journalism can be glad to know that his paper was left to his successors in such form and under such conditions as will enable them to continue his work on the lines of his better or best sense to which he always would have his staff attain and always regretted if he ever under the temperature of interest or of passion or of competition failed himself to attain joseph pulitzer was the most aggressive and forceful figure in the journalism of his day and will always rank among the greatest the country has ever known with tremendous earnestness he devoted his whole life to his calling sacrificing friendship and all else to the one purpose of making a newspaper that drew its strength solely from the people and gave back that strength solely and intensely in the people interest mr pulitzer knew no other interest and had no other nothing was permitted to stand between him and his sense of public duty he attacked fearlessly and pursued relentlessly he was often wrong cruelly wrong but he was much oftener right and his career is marked with triumphs that are notable advances in popular government baltimore md oct 29--american journalism has lost one of its ablest leaders by the death of mr joseph pulitzer while i could not approve all of his methods and policies i recognized in him a strong force that made for the real advancement of the press of the whole country some of his achievements were well-nigh marvelous and aroused in others a determination to match his successes by similar successes of their own he took the new york world when it was well-nigh moribund and transformed it into one of the best newspapers in the united states such a man can have no monument equal to the great paper that he made baltimore md oct 29--mr pulitzer was an editor with a sense of public responsibility he had a genuine sympathy with and friendship for the people whatever may be thought of his judgment of news and his method of presenting it his newspapers were always vital and vibrant he was a great and fearless editor knowing neither friend nor foe and contemptuous of business office considerations the last years of his life were clouded by physical affliction and suffering that would have broken any but a dauntless spirit washington oct 29--mr pulitzer death is a loss to journalism always to the fore in journalistic enterprises fearless in the conduct of his paper he will be long remembered vigorous in thought and action he was always to be reckoned with most able in the editorial room he had full knowledge of the details of his great business he was by nature a partisan he had strong likes and dislikes his great ability was acknowledged by all who knew him his sons will be worthy successors of their great father chicago oct 29--the success of the great publications which he made such powerful factors in modern newspaperdom tells the story of joseph pulitzer dominating characteristics better than any other possible eulogy the story of his rise from poverty and obscurity to affluence and power is proof that there is opportunity in this country for those who are capable and ambitious chicago oct 29--the death of joseph pulitzer is a serious loss to journalism his fairness in his business dealing and his editorial policy stand unparalleled his success in building up the greatest newspaper in the country should stand as a monument he overcame great odds and won in the face of criticism his success attributed to a never- varying principle of justice is his vindication st louis mo oct 29--in three respects joseph pulitzer influence upon american journalism was very great he systematized and established sensation; he was the most consistent advocate of the newspaper duty of public service; he did a great deal to destroy the old idea of party organ grinding there were some serious faults in his journalistic code but it had distinguished virtues also which will live kansas city mo oct 29--joseph pulitzer i believe was the leading journalist of his day the pioneer in modernizing the newspaper it was his discovery that newspapers must be entertaining his energy ability and originality in applying this idea brought unprecedented success to the world and made a lasting impression on journalism even newspapers that believed his methods extreme could not escape being profoundly influenced by them blind and ill as he was much of his life he was a tremendous factor in american affairs omaha neb oct 29--i believe joseph pulitzer will be ranked by all historians with the foremost of american journalists and that he has impressed his personality upon american newspaper making more than any other one man although self-made he saw the possibilities of a journalistic profession as is attested by his foundation for a school of journalism in conjunction with columbia university the resolution offered by me and adopted by the associated press in 1903 congratulating him upon his purpose was recognition of this far-sightedness a man of wide culture commanding intellect and compelling genius died yesterday in joseph pulitzer that he was much more than this by reason of his tireless zeal in the public service the world is the imperfect but sincere witness this paper is his chief life-work it has been his absorbing passion not as an end but solely as a means to the expression of his ideas and ideas for human welfare mr pulitzer brought from his old world association with social wrongs and political abuses a deeper appreciation of free government than most men feel who were born to a share in its birthright he brought also a high regard for order and authority and this grew stronger with him to the end he saw no true progress without law; no true growth without justice; no true democracy that was not broad enough to shelter all he saw in our government of checked and balanced powers the highest type of human administration yet devised; and against strange new doctrines whether of executive usurpation or of short-cuts to hasty popular action or of conquest and dominion over men of other lands and races he burned as a living flame not this the place or time to tell of joseph pulitzer great services to peace; of the lash he laid upon corruption in high place; of his practical and persistent leadership in movements of political reform or public purification of his intense devotion to liberty and his passionate hatred of wrong and injustice these are an inseparable part of the history of the united states for thirty years we would do-day dwell rather upon his many manifestations of warm-hearted interest in lesser things that would smooth the path of the helpless but that will never live in the formal records of what has been good in the world more is due to mr pulitzer power and his personal attention than most men would deem possible noting his heavy handicap of physical infirmity and his long wanderings in search of health of its shortcomings he had been the keenest critic and his interest was unflagging to the very day of his death the cable and the telegraph have brought to it his constant guidance his ever-ready protest against hasty judgment his inspiration to endeavor the high ideal he set for himself he better told than any one can tell for him when from his sick-bed at wiesbaden the day the corner-stone of the pulitzer building was laid oct 10 1889 he cabled to the world this message: god grant that this structure be the enduring home of a newspaper forever unsatisfied with merely printing news--forever fighting every form of wrong--forever independent-- forever advancing in enlightenment and progress--forever wedded to truly democratic ideas--forever aspiring to be a moral force---forever rising to a higher plane of perfection as a public institution god grant that the world may forever strive toward the highest ideals--be both a daily schoolhouse and a daily forum both a daily teacher and a daily tribune and instrument of justice a terror to crime an aid to education an exponent of true americanism let it ever be remembered that this edifice owes its existence to the public; that its architect is popular favor; that its cornerstone is liberty and justice; that its every stone comes from the people and represents public approval for public services rendered god forbid that the vast army following the standard of the world should in this or in future generations ever find it faithless to those ideas and moral principles to which alone it owes its life and without which i would rather have it perish that mr pulitzer himself lived by these precepts and died true to them the editorial page and policy of the world have been the daily witness for twenty-eight years mr joseph pulitzer brought to this city from the west new ideas and a definite purpose and he had the boldness and energy to carry them out a pioneer in paths which have become familiar he proved that a very large constituency was ready to welcome a newspaper of the kind which he was prepared to produce the methods which he employed were unpleasing to a great number of good citizens partly no doubt because they exemplified a passion for publicity which shocked conservative instincts; and that antagonism which he probably regarded as a decoration rather than a reproach has not disappeared but we think that in recent years there has been little disposition to underrate the value of the services which the world has rendered not without unwarranted judgments and grave mistakes to the general advancement of civic and political morality nor however opinions might otherwise differ has it been possible not to feel sympathy and admiration for a man who never permitted physical disabilities of a peculiarly depressing nature to impede the activities of a keen and powerful mind the death of mr joseph pulitzer ends a remarkable and dramatic career his life was a romance showing what can be accomplished in a country like america he came to the united states a young man very poor quite unknown and the unthinking who met him at that time might have said hopelessly handicapped but instead of being handicapped he was powerfully equipped with wonderful originality phenomenal insight and bewildering energy he was essentially the architect of his own fortune when he reached the zenith of his power about twenty-four years ago he was 40 years old few men ever accomplished so much at that age for years newspaper workers have known of the very delicate health of mr joseph pulitzer proprietor of the new york world yet perhaps the shock of his death came to none with more force than to those of his own calling and this because though long virtually blind and sorely tried with other ills he had continued to be a tremendous power in american journalism and politics by all newspaper men of impartial judgment he was regarded as the foremost editor and publisher of his day incomparable was his success in winning readers to his publications beyond all other newspaper makers in the united states he held them to his way of thinking away from his paper hundreds of miles in the united states or thousands on the other side of the atlantic in search of better health he never took his touch off the intimate details of the huge business of his properties mr pulitzer history differs only in detail from that of many successful newspaper men of his time at the outset they cut their coat according to their cloth by making the sort of paper that is immediately salable--sensationally yellow fighting to attract attention neither too fair nor too truthful at any rate the sobering process began in the world and has continued until now when the new york world is one of the fairest and most accurate as well as one of the most interesting newspapers in the country nor is such virtue its own reward the world is more prosperous now than it ever was before a great journalist is dead and the world is his monument his constructive ability was remarkable so was his industry mr pulitzer career closed before he became an old man as literary and professional men are classed the world history and mr pulitzer for the last twenty-eight years are closely identified he made his newspaper one of the powers of the continent his clear understanding of the american people and their institutions and his abundant genius gained him his extraordinary success his career ws one of the most brilliant inspiring and successful that has ever been known in the journalism of the world from the time he started as a reporter in st louis he showed positive genius as a journalist no obstacle was too great for him to overcome he had the nerve to buy a bankrupt newspaper which was sold by auction for $2000 and in a few years made it a stanch and permanent success in 1883 he had the pluck to buy a failing newspaper in new york one which had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and in a single year put it on a sound substantial basis personally mr pulitzer was one of the most charming and entertaining men of his time as those who knew him intimately can readily testify he was devoted to his profession he believed in publicity as a means of promoting what was best for the people and to expose graft and wrongdoing he was ever earnest in promoting with all his mighty power what he believed was for the greatest good of the greatest number joseph pulitzer had a genius for touching the heart through his newspapers he was the father of modern yellow journalism as the elder bennett was of the earlier type and he has had a vast influence in creating the character of the press of to-day a mixture of good and evil qualities with the evil rather dominating pulitzer was however a sincere democrat a real lover of the masses and he honestly tried to serve them he had been a valiant fighter in behalf of many popular causes he had a tender heart and generous instincts and a strongly sentimental nature it must in justice be said that he had never attained the editorial influence upon the thought of the country of which he was ambitious in american journalism joseph pulitzer occupied a position that was unique he transformed the world from a position of original sensationalism into one of the greatest newspapers of distinctive features that made it one of the most popular of the foremost journals of the country he possessed a peculiar constructiveness that was his own and which had an influence on journalism throughout the country one of the greatest journalists that ever controlled an american newspaper or left his impression upon american life has closed a strenuous and brilliant career joseph pulitzer leaves a gap in the public life of his adopted country which will be felt in the profession and out of it it is not necessary to subscribe to mr pulitzer doctrines as to all great questions or to ignore the faults and mistakes of his able and masterful newspapers in order to recognize the heavy credit balance which his career piled up he paid well for the opportunities his chosen country gave him his rise no less than his services as a great publisher and editor must be an inspiration to a multitude of ambitious and stout-hearted young men joseph pulitzer was without question one of the most important figures in the history of american journalism the work that he did was great and varied but perhaps his greatest achievement was his changing when he knew that the time had come to change aghast perhaps at the storm he had raised but more probably firmly convinced that \"yellowness\" and extreme sensationalism could not retain a newspaper permanently in the esteem of the people mr pulitzer executed a remarkable right-about-face the world editorially became one of the sanest ablest most unbiased newspapers ever published its news columns while still delighting in playing the news for all it was worth lost their distinctive \"yellowness\" the world to-day ranks as one of the most respected newspapers in america it has quite lived down its former reputation and fortunately mr pulitzer lived to see the rehabilitation made complete but little known to the public at large joseph pulitzer was nevertheless one of the most remarkable men of his generation it may well be doubted whether any other exercised so extended an influence upon the journalism of the last thirty years the transformation which was wrought in newspaper methods under his leadership is a story familiar to many not so generally known but if anything more extraordinary has been the manner in which mr pulitzer has gained and controlled during the last twenty years the great newspaper property which he brought into existence with the death of joseph pulitzer the greatest figure in american journalism passes from the scene there have been notable newspaper men before him--bennett greely raymond dana childs medill and others men of wonderful sagacity capacity and enterprise but for the most part they were men of high development in one particular direction mr pulitzer had a many-sided personality and he excelled in almost every direction']"
